AB Background: There has been an increasing emphasis on empowering pre-service and in-service science teachers to attend student reasoning and use formative assessments to guide student learning in recent years. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore pre-service science teachers' pedagogical capacity for formative assessment. Sample: This study took place in Turkey. The participants include 53 pre-service science teachers in their final year of schooling. All but two of the participants are female. Design and methods: We used a mixed-methods methodology in pursing this inquiry. Participants analyzed 28 responses to seven two-tiered questions given by four students of different ability levels. We explored their ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses in students' answers. We paid particular attention to the things that the pre-service science teachers noticed in students' explanations, the types of inferences they made about students' conceptual understanding, and the affordances of pedagogical decisions they made. Results: The results show that the majority of participants made an evaluative judgment (i.e. the answer is correct or incorrect) in their analyses of students' answers. Similarly, the majority of the participants recognized the type of mistake that the students made. However, they failed to successfully elaborate on fallacies, limitations, or strengths in student reasoning. We also asked the participants to make pedagogical decisions related to what needs to be done next in order to help the students to achieve academic objectives. Results show that 8% of the recommended instructional strategies were of no affordance, 64% of low-affordance, and 28% were of high affordance in terms of helping students achieve the academic objectives. Conclusion: If our goal is to improve pre-service science teachers' noticing skills, and the affordance of feedback that they provide, engaging them in activities that asks them to attend to students' ideas and reasoning may be useful.

AB Background: In the last few decades, researchers have turned their attention to students' understanding of scientific concepts at different school levels. The results indicate that the learners have different ideas, and most of them are inaccurate in terms of those generally accepted by the scientific community.
   Purpose: This study was undertaken to describe the development, validation and use of a three-tier multiple-choice diagnostic test (PEMT) to reveal Turkish high school students' common misconceptions in terms of the photoelectric effect.
   Sample: In this study, 243 students (male=86, female=137) from six high schools made up the sample which comprised approximately 76% of the 11(th) grade population.
   Design and Methods: Based on findings from the literature, open-ended questions and interviews, the PEMT was developed and administered to 243 students. The data was analysed descriptively.
   Results: The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of the scores was estimated as .83. Construct, content and face validities were established by senior experts and through the use of statistical techniques. The findings denoted that the test is a valid and reliable measure of students' qualitative understanding of the photoelectric concept. The results revealed that the majority of the students demonstrated a limited understanding of the photoelectric effect and have five prevalent misconceptions. These are: (1) an increase in intensity would provide the photon with enough energy to release electrons; (2) the photoelectric effect results from the ionization of atoms through the interaction with light; (3) a light beam whose photons have smaller energies than the work function would release electrons with the help of a voltage source; (4) the number of photoelectrons depends on the energy of the photon and (5) the photon has kinetic energy and it depends on the colour of light. The last two misconceptions were discovered in the current study.
   Conclusion: The findings indicated that the PEMT is a reliable and valid measuring tool for investigating high school students' conceptual understanding and misconceptions. Future studies could use the PEMT as a tool for assessing the misconceptions of high school students, pre-service science or pre-service physics teachers.

AB Background: Scientific models have important roles in science and science education. For scientists, they provide a means for generating new knowledge or function as an accessible summary of scientific studies. In science education, on the other hand, they are accessible representations of abstract concepts, and are also organizational frameworks to teach and learn inaccessible facts. As being indispensable parts of learning and doing science, use of scientific models in science classes should be reinforced. At this point, uncovering pre-service science teachers' (PSTs) understandings of scientific models are of great importance since they will design and conduct teaching situations for their students. Purpose: The study aimed to provide an answer to the research question: What understandings do PSTs possess about scientific models? Sample: The sample of the study consisted of 14 PSTs enrolled in an Elementary Science Education program in a public university in Ankara, Turkey. Design and methods: Data were collected by using an open-item instrument and semi-structured interviews, and were analyzed by using qualitative data analysis methods. Results: Findings showed that PSTs held fragmented views of models by having informed views in some aspects while having naive views on others. That is, although they displayed a constructivist orientation by acknowledging the presence of multiple models for the same phenomenon depending on scientists' perspectives or creativity involved in the production of scientific knowledge, PSTs also expressed logical positivist views by believing that models should be close to the real phenomena that they represent. Findings further revealed that PSTs generally conceptualized models' materialistic uses, yet they did not think much about their theoretical and conceptual uses. It was observed that roles like reifying and visualizing were overestimated and models were dominantly characterized as three-dimensional representations. Conclusions: It is clear that PSTs, having difficulties in grasping the concept of models, would possibly have problems in planning their lessons effectively and would not develop accurate concepts in their students. These findings apparently support the need for appropriate pedagogic training of PSTs to scientifically reflect on and professionally make use of models in science classes.

AB Background: Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is critical for effective teaching with technology. However, generally science teacher education programs do not help pre-service teachers develop TPACK.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess pre-service science teachers' TPACK over a semester-long Science Methods.
   Sample: Twenty-seven pre-service science teachers took the course toward the end of their four-year teacher education program.
   Design and method: The study employed the case study methodology. Lesson plans and microteaching observations were used as data collection tools. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge-based lesson plan assessment instrument (TPACK-LpAI) and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Observation Protocol (TPACK-OP) were used to analyze data obtained from observations and lesson plans.
   Results: The results showed that the TPACK-focused Science Methods course had an impact on pre-service teachers' TPACK to varying degrees. Most importantly, the course helped teachers gain knowledge of effective usage of educational technology tools.
   Conclusion: Teacher education programs should provide opportunities to pre-service teachers to develop their TPACK so that they can effectively integrate technology into their teaching.

AB This study examined the relationships between pre-service science teachers' teaching self-efficacy, locus of control, attitude towards science teaching and teaching anxiety. A conceptual model of these relationships was examined using data collected from 356 pre-service elementary science teachers. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, zero-order correlations and path analysis. Results showed that attitude towards science teaching was linked positively and teaching anxiety negatively to pre-service science teachers' science teaching self-efficacy. Additionally, pre-service science teachers' locus of control was found to be related positively to attitude towards science teaching and related negatively to science teaching anxiety. Finally, pre-service science teachers' attitude towards science teaching had a negative effect on science teaching anxiety. These results point to the importance of positive role modelling and increased teaching practice in pre-service science teacher education to emphasise the effect of teachers' attitudes and efforts on student performance.

AB Technological pedagogical content knowledge-practical (TPACK-P) refers to the knowledge construct that teachers in the digital era develop for and from their teaching practices with technology. This study explored a standard-setting method using item response theory to cross-validate ranks of proficiency levels and examine in-service and pre-service science teachers' knowledge about and application of TPACK-P in Taiwan. A sample of 99 participants (52 pre-service and 47 in-service science teachers) completed a 17-item TPACK-P questionnaire that described their typical responses, opinions, or actions in different instructional scenarios. Initial analysis of these responses revealed a correlation (r = 0.87) between the ranks of proficiency levels and those previously identified that validated the hierarchical structure of the four proficiency levels (1-lack of use, 2-simple adoption, 3-infusive application, and 4-reflective application). The second analysis located the thresholds of the four proficiency levels in the two dimensions of knowledge about and application of TPACK-P. It was found that there were no significant differences between in-service and pre-service teachers' TPACK-P and that most of the participants displayed knowledge about TPACK-P at Levels 2 and 3, but their application was at Level 1. The validated four proficiency levels coupled with typical performances can be viewed as a roadmap of science teachers' TPACK-P development. The gap between the knowledge about and application of TPACK-P suggests that further practical experiences in supportive environments are needed in science teacher education programs. Only when teachers gain and learn from practical usage of technology to support science education can their TPACK-P be further developed and strengthened. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present case study explored the teaching belief systems of pre-service science teachers (PSTs), including epistemological beliefs, self-efficacy beliefs, conceptions of science learning and teaching and pedagogical content knowledge. Based on their epistemological scores, three PSTs who were categorised as exhibiting naive, moderately sophisticated and sophisticated beliefs were selected for analysis. Each of the participants was interviewed individually on four occasions and prepared a lesson plan. Analyses of interview transcripts and lesson plans indicated that PSTs' epistemological beliefs were differentially related to particular domains and topics and that their previous learning experiences and observations were more likely to influence their teaching behaviours. The conclusion section presents suggestions for implementing study findings and recommendations for future research.

AB "Putting the patient in the driver's seat" is one of the top issues on the health policy agenda in Finland. One of the means believed to promote patient empowerment and patient centeredness is the introduction and further expansion of choice policies with accompanying competition between public and private service providers. However, the Finnish health care system has a highly decentralized administration with multiple funding sources and three different types of providers that people can seek primary care from (municipal health centers, occupational health care services, and private sector providers). This complicates the implementation of choice at the level of primary health care. In this paper, we describe the current policy debates and initiatives promoting the expansion of the choice of primary care provider in Finland. We examine the legislation and policies that have contributed to the current, complex service system in Finland. In light of this examination, we critically discuss the current debate on choice policies as well as the introduction of choice in the context of primary health care. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB This paper shows how service science principles may be used for engineering and realizing improved public transport services. It approaches a value co-creation perspective for the management of public transport service operations based on an activity-based model of a generic service system that allows capturing requirements for software intensive service systems. The main focus is on specific implementation issues of the activity-based model of the generic service system, with a strong accent on its most representative component, the service set-up and configuring unit. This model is applied in a case study for planning of a public transport service and describes how a specific service reconfiguring request is formulated. This examination is further used as a document of requirements that drives the construction of an agent-based model expressing value-creation interactions among service system's stakeholders in public transport services. The usefulness of the developed agent-based model for the analysis of service systems operational capabilities is suggested through simulation. A business scenario related to the management of public transport services is described, and the defined agent-based model is executed with the Presage2 multi-agent programming platform in order to capture specific issues of piece-of-work planning. The proposed approach, evaluated on the simple working scenario, fosters the role of service interaction modeling in supporting a public transport service system to dynamically adapt its operational capabilities in delivering good public transport services, as more or less quantifiable changes can affect service delivery over time.

AB There is widespread agreement that science learning always builds upon students' existing ideas and that science teachers should possess knowledge of learners. This study aims at investigating pre-service science teachers' knowledge of student misconceptions and difficulties, a crucial component of PCK, on Newton's Third Law. A questionnaire was designed and conducted to 143 pre-service science teachers enrolled in a normal university in China. A comparison between participants' predictions and student actual outcomes was detected. The result revealed a tendency for pre-service science teachers to under-predict the problem-solving ability of senior high school students. Furthermore, most pre-service science teachers neglected two common learning difficulties in Newton's Third Law. It seems that there is a need to help pre-service science teachers be aware of their own misunderstandings about students.

AB Despite the importance of the theory of evolution to scientific knowledge, a number of misconceptions continue to be found among teachers and undergraduate students. The aim of the present study was to describe and characterise knowledge about evolution among 120 freshman undergraduate students of two natural sciences programmes (environmental biology and veterinary medicine), 80 pre-service science teachers (elementary and biology) and 45 in-service teachers (elementary and biology high school) in Santiago, Chile. The research was carried out based on an eight-question questionnaire about evolution acceptance and understanding. The instrument included seven Likert-scale questions and one open-ended question. An analysis of the data revealed that more than 70% of teachers (pre-service and in-service) and undergraduate students recognised the theory of evolution as established scientific knowledge. When participants discussed the mechanism of evolution in the open-ended question, the most prevalent responses from students and teachers (33%) explained evolution as need-driven changes for survival purposes. Only 13% of the responses could be considered Darwinian, and 10% of responses included more than one view of evolution. The Darwinian responses generally included three important aspects: variation, inheritance and differential reproduction. The implications for biology teacher education are also discussed in this study.

AB Problem Statement: University students usually lack the skills to rigorously define a multi-dimensional real-life problem and its limitations in an explicit, clear and testable way, which prevents them from forming a reliable method, obtaining relevant results and making balanced judgments to solve a problem.
   Purpose of the Study: The study examines the processes undergone by students in two projects and the results of these projects. One of the projects was on the subject of heat waste in the buildings of a university's school of education. The other project was a new version of that project conducted by a group of students in the following year.
   Method: The study was conducted with eight pre-service science teachers who were third-year students in the Science Teaching and Laboratory Practices course at a state university's education school located in Turkey's Marmara Region. Case study, a qualitative research method, is used to obtain detailed and in-depth information. The research data for this report were obtained from the students' project posters, interviews with the instructor and semi-structured interview records of interviews with the students.
   Findings: In the first project, pre-service teachers had serious difficulty identifying a testable research problem they encountered every day as well as developing a method to solve such a problem. Therefore, the collected data could not be analyzed because of the complexity of the data, the failure to adjust the plan to reality and the abundance of variables. Pre-service teachers in the second project began by determining an explicit, clear and testable research problem, including dependent and independent variables, regarding the waste of heat in university buildings. Two factors were very influential for this project's success. First, re-evaluating a previous research problem was more advantageous than determining a research problem from scratch, which can be explained by the fact that science is a process that progresses cyclically and cumulatively. Second, there was more intense dialogue and cooperation between the instructor and the students in the second project than in the first project.
   Conclusion and Recommendations: The present study revealed that when linear scientific research project practices are replaced with cyclical scientific research processes, new and more advanced projects with a wider sphere of influence can be achieved. Providing pre-service teachers with scientific research opportunities is a way to help spread the attitudes and skills needed for research, development and innovative thinking more widely throughout society.

AB Customer expectation has been an important issue across different academic fields. Customer expectation management enables service providers to provide customers with suitable services in order to achieve high customer satisfaction especially in real-time dynamic service contexts. Understanding actual customer expectations is the primary step before managing customer expectations. However, to our knowledge, there is no research investigating how to measure real-time customer expectations during service delivery. Hence, this study proposes a customer expectation measurement mechanism and evaluates its feasibility and reliability through simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism offers researchers and service providers a feasible approach to measuring and managing real-time customer expectations at service encounters for building satisfactory customer experiences.

AB Inability to link the acid-base concepts with daily life phenomena (as contexts) highlights the need for further research on the context-based acid-base chemistry. In this vein, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different teaching designs (REACT strategy, 5Es learning model and traditional (existing) instruction) relevant with 'acids and bases' subject on pre-service science teachers' conceptions and attitudes towards chemistry and to compare them with each other. Within quasi-experimental research design, the sample comprised of 95 pre-service science teachers from Faculty of Education in Giresun University, Turkey. Three intact groups were randomly assigned as either experimental and control groups. To gather data, Acid-Base Chemistry Concept Test (ABCCT), Chemistry Attitudes and Experiences Questionnaire (CAEQ) and semi-structured interviews were used. The results denote that REACT strategy is effective in helping the pre-service science teachers retain their gained conceptions in long-term memory whilst 5Es learning model is efficient in achieving conceptual learning. Finally, future studies should test the effects of REACT strategy and 5Es learning model on different variables (i.e. sample, subject, scientific process skills, scientific inquiry) over a longer period of time (i.e. one semester or one-year).

AB In service industry application, there is vague and qualitative information required to be processed properly, for example, to identify customer preferences in order to provide adequate services. From literature, Rough Set Theory (RST) has been indicated to be one of promising approaches to cope with vagueness in a large scale database. Basically, the rough set approach integrates learning-from-example techniques, extracts rules from a data set of interest, and discovers data regularities. Most of the existing RS based approaches are able to implement rule induction but it is very time consuming from computation perspective particularly from a large database. To date, there is a demand to generate and analyze business decision rules based on dynamical data sets and conclude such rules on the daily basis in the service industry. Therefore, in this study, an Incremental Weight Incorporated Rule Identification (IWIRI) algorithm is proposed to fulfill such demand. The proposed approach is proficient to efficiently process in-coming data (objetcs) and generate updated decision rules without re-computation efforts in the database. Identification of features based on the customer's preference and implementation of the proposed algorithm are summarized in the case study. This paper forms the basis for solving many other similar problems that occur in service industries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the impact of argumentation on pre-service science teachers' (PST) conceptual understanding of chemical equilibrium. The sample consisted of 57 first-year PSTs enrolled in a teacher education program in Turkey. Thirty two of the 57 PSTs who participated in this study were in the experimental group and 25 in the control group. The experimental group students learned the concept of chemical equilibrium through argumentation; the control group students learned the same concepts through business as usual (i.e. lectures, supported by laboratory experiments). The intervention lasted for 12 instructional hours, of which 4 were spent in the laboratory. The chemical equilibrium concept test was administered to both groups of students one week after the intervention. The results show that the experimental group students performed significantly better than then control group students on the chemical equilibrium concept test. The mean difference between two groups is 14.026. This difference is statistically significant at ((star)p < 0.001). However, the control group students performed significantly better on the comprehensive course final exam.

AB Learning by teaching is an educational method developed by Jean-Pol Martin for foreign language lessons and is commonly used in Germany. This study discusses a reconstruction of learning by teaching as developed for use in a science context where in the adapted version of this method is introduced, the views of pre-service science teachers are explored, and the effectiveness of this method for gaining 21st century skills is examined. The qualitative case study was conducted with 33 pre-service science teachers. Data was gathered through focus group discussions and structured written interviews, and analyzed using content analysis. The views of pre-service science teachers were examined concerning the advantages of the following 11 themes: the advantages of learning by teaching, preparing research questions and working together to find answers through research, preparing and implementing activities, the role of the teacher, a letter writing activity, the strengths of learning by teaching, the weaknesses of learning by teaching, difficulties faced during its implementation, the use of learning by teaching in teacher-training programs, other lessons appropriate for the use of learning by teaching, and how to apply the experiences gained to the future. Following a two-year pilot study and implementation of the final version, learning by teaching within the context of science was found to be an effective method for gaining 21st century skills.

AB This paper explores science teachers' experiences, views, and preferences of what constitutes effective teacher professional development. The research method utilised both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The former was used with responses from closed-ended questions while responses to an open-ended question were analysed qualitatively. The questionnaire was administrated to science teachers in Saudi Arabia of both genders with a variety of teaching experiences, science specialisms and to those teaching in primary, middle and secondary stage schools. The findings indicate that teachers have concerns about continuing professional development (CPD) programmes offered to them. Teachers' description of CPD showed that they were passive recipients of a pre-packed programme paving the way to how they form their professional identity. Teachers reflected on the aspects that can lead to effective CPD. Drawing on the findings, this paper presents a framework for effective CPD for science teachers where teachers are collaborative, proactive as leaders of reform and with positive professional identities in a context of reform.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among pre-service science teachers' conceptual knowledge of electric current, motivational beliefs, and self-regulation. One hundred and twenty-seven students (female = 107, male = 20) enrolled in the science education program of a public university in Ankara participated the study. A concept map technique was used to determine students' conceptual knowledge level of electric current. To determine students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation, a scale developed by Velayutham, Aldridge, and Fraser (2011) was first translated into Turkish and adapted to Turkish culture and then used as a measurement tool. Results showed that students' motivational beliefs were positively associated with their self-regulation, and students' task value, self-efficacy, and self-regulation were positively related with students' conceptual knowledge of electric current. These results show that students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation have important roles in students' conceptual knowledge level when assessed using concept map technique.

AB Evolution continues to be a controversial topic around the world but nowhere is this more apparent locally than in the Southeastern region of the USA. In this study, we explored acceptance and rejection of evolution among pre-service science teachers in a teaching college in the rural Southeast and sought to determine (1) what relationships exist between the worldview variables and acceptance of evolution among pre-service secondary science teachers? and (2) Which combination of these variables explains the most statistically significant amount of variance in acceptance of evolution among pre-service secondary science teachers? Regression analysis was used to determine the best-fit model predicting levels of acceptance in this sample, explaining 45 % of variance in acceptance of evolution in 4 variables. The result of this study sheds light on possible remediation for low acceptance of evolution and directions for improved preparation of future science teachers relative to teaching and learning evolution.

AB The concept of "service" has been characterized in different disciplines and by different authors from various points of view. This variety of characterizations has emerged because although this notion seems intuitive, it is far from trivial, with many interrelated perspectives. Given their importance in enterprise computing and Service Science in general, we believe that a clear account of services and service-related concepts is necessary and would serve as a basis for communication, consensus and alignment among approaches and perspectives. In this paper we propose a commitment-based account of the notion of service captured in a core reference ontology called UFO-S. We address the commitments established between service providers and customers, and show how such commitments affect the service lifecycle. Moreover, we show that the commitment-based account can serve to harmonize different notions of service in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Teachers' Ways of Talking About Nature of Science and Its Teaching

AB Nature of science (NOS) has for a long time been regarded as a key component in science teaching. Much research has focused on students' and teachers' views of NOS, while less attention has been paid to teachers' perspectives on NOS teaching. This article focuses on in-service science teachers' ways of talking about NOS and NOS teaching, e.g. what they talk about as possible and valuable to address in the science classroom, in Swedish compulsory school. These teachers (N = 12) are, according to the national curriculum, expected to teach NOS, but have no specific NOS training. The analytical framework described in this article consists of five themes that include multiple perspectives on NOS. The results show that teachers have less to say when they talk about NOS teaching than when they talk about NOS in general. This difference is most obvious for issues related to different sociocultural aspects of science. Difficulties in-and advantages of-NOS teaching, as put forth by the teachers, are discussed in relation to traditional science teaching, and in relation to teachers' perspectives on for which students science teaching will be perceived as meaningful and comprehensible. The results add to understanding teachers' reasoning when confronted with the idea that NOS should be part of science teaching. This in turn provides useful information that can support the development of NOS courses for teachers.

TI Enhancing Teachers' Awareness About Relations Between Science and

SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION

ID EDUCATION; WORLD; TEXTBOOKS; STUDENTS; UNIVERSE; VIEWS; ISSUE
AB Educators advocate that science education can help the development of more responsible worldviews when students learn not only scientific concepts, but also about science, or "nature of science". Cosmology can help the formation of worldviews because this topic is embedded in socio-cultural and religious issues. Indeed, during the Cold War period, the cosmological controversy between Big Bang and Steady State theory was tied up with political and religious arguments. The present paper discusses a didactic sequence developed for and applied in a pre-service science teacher-training course on history of science. After studying the historical case, pre-service science teachers discussed how to deal with possible conflicts between scientific views and students' personal worldviews related to religion. The course focused on the study of primary and secondary sources about cosmology and religion written by cosmologists such as Georges LemaItre, Fred Hoyle and the Pope Pius XII. We used didactic strategies such as short seminars given by groups of pre-service teachers, videos, computer simulations, role-play, debates and preparation of written essays. Along the course, most pre-service teachers emphasized differences between science and religion and pointed out that they do not feel prepared to conduct classroom discussions about this topic. Discussing the relations between science and religion using the history of cosmology turned into an effective way to teach not only science concepts but also to stimulate reflections about nature of science. This topic may contribute to increasing students' critical stance on controversial issues, without the need to explicitly defend certain positions, or disapprove students' cultural traditions. Moreover, pre-service teachers practiced didactic strategies to deal with this kind of unusual content.

AB Pre-service science teachers' conceptual understanding of astronomical concepts and their misconceptions in these concepts is crucial to study since they will teach these subjects in middle schools after becoming teachers. This study aimed to explore both seventh-grade students' and the science teachers' understanding of astronomical concepts and to diagnose the misconceptions of seventh-grade students and pre-service science teachers regarding some basic astronomy concepts derived from a three-tier test. The test was administered to 105 pre-service science teachers and 91 seventh-grade students. The best conceptual understanding was related to the properties of the Sun. The students and pre-service science teachers have some common misconceptions in astronomy. Pre-service teachers mostly have misconceptions not regarding complex concepts but instead in very basic knowledge of astronomy. There is a need to take serious measures to correct the misconceptions of the teachers, since under such circumstances it is optimistic to expect them to teach the subject correctly.

AB This paper describes an exploration towards the transposition of service science principles into design guidelines. This aims at capturing value co-creation service interactions embedding customer experience in service design and delivery activities. The new Socio-Technical Systems Engineering (STSE) process is proposed to guide improved design, and it is exemplified with a new real time service that provides integrated information for trip planning in a city. The STSE process supports a high level visual modelling approach assisted by model execution and simulation tools. From a service engineering perspective, the outcomes of this process are artefacts that automatically support consistency among design steps and effective integration of customer experience and stakeholder requirements through iterative cycles related to service design. The application of the STSE process in the design of an exploratory case study of a real time information and travel planning service is validated through simulation using an executable representation of requirements. It can be executed over more complex transport service offerings, with different resource allocation algorithms, or different public transport planning services over a sample of real users requesting information. Results of such a simulation are beneficial for the users, for the service providers, and for the authorities managing public transport in city or metropolitan areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This descriptive study investigated the implementation practices of secondary science teachers who differentiate instruction. Participants included seven high school science teachers purposefully selected from four different schools located in a mid-Atlantic state. Purposeful selection ensured participants included differentiated instruction (DI) in their lesson implementation. Data included semi-structured interviews and field notes from a minimum of four classroom observations, selected to capture the variety of differentiation strategies employed. These data were analyzed using a constant-comparative approach. Each classroom observation was scored using the validated Differentiated Instruction Implementation Matrix-Modified, which captured both the extent to which critical indicators of DI were present in teachers' instruction and the performance levels at which they engaged in these components of DI. Results indicated participants implemented a variety of differentiation strategies in their classrooms with varying proficiency. Evidence suggested all participants used instructional modifications that required little advance preparation to accommodate differences in students' interests and learning profile. Four of the seven participants implemented more complex instructional strategies that required substantial advance preparation by the teacher. Most significantly, this study provides practical strategies for in-service science teachers beginning to differentiate instruction and recommendations for professional development and preservice science teacher education.

ID SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; POWER LAWS; PARETO; MODEL
AB The study of service value networks adds a new dimension of investigation to industrial systems: human networks. Existing literature shows humans hyper-network to co-create value within and outside of the traditional structures of an organization or an extended enterprise-such as social networking for innovation and e-commerce for supply chain. Since human networks tend to be composite and multi-dimensional, they need new results to understand how networks collide during economic activities and what new coalesced networks will result. The hyper-network model uniquely describes this multi-layered evolving nature of human networks and reveals some of the basic networking properties either directly from the initial community base networks or directly from the colliding single networks. This article answers an important question about service value networks: What are the connection patterns of a network of networks, such as the distribution of the number of connections at a node-the degree distribution? We develop formulae to determine four prototypical classes of hyper-networks, which constitute a baseline analysis to the new study of network evolution for network science and service science.

AB Knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) are a distinct category of business-to-business services, with unique implications for current understandings of value within the field of service science. KIBS engagements often involve multiple stakeholders with sometimes differing assessments of value. Moreover, stakeholders' assessment of value is not based solely on an engagement's deliverables; it also takes into account the collaborative process of producing these deliverables and the indirect outcomes resulting from the integration of deliverables and process results as new resources in line with each stakeholder's interests. Supporting the design of KIBS engagements thus needs to enable a multistakeholder and multilevel measurement of value.
   This article identifies requirements for modeling KIBS engagements in a manner that addresses their specific characteristics and can support their design; requirements were derived from a multiple-case study of value cocreation in this domain. The article also presents value cocreation modeling (VCM), a technique developed to fulfill these requirements. In VCM, indicators help measure and evaluate elements that support each stakeholder's value assessment at the process, deliverable, and outcome levels. VCM can be used as a conceptual tool by KIBS professionals to establish and monitor KIBS engagements and take corrective actions as needed for successful outcomes.

ID INFORMATION
AB In this paper a particular approach to value-assessment for information and communication technology (ICT)-based services is explored. The core of the paper is a large-scale case study that provides evidence of how proposed value mechanisms work in practice.
   The mechanisms that are described in this paper are grounded in bringing together different views on the definition of a service, in particular when dealing with administrative processes. The notion of a value-leak is introduced, as an indicator that points to services where the erosion of value can be reduced or stopped. Value-leaks go beyond process deficiencies, and in the case study it becomes clear how efficiency considerations, emotions, effectiveness, caring, hospitality, and so on play an important role in value-leaks.
   A key research question is the detection of potential value-leaks in services. In this paper, service science for ICT-based services follows the rigor of information science by introducing the notion of service imperfections. Next, two research propositions are put forward, expressing the relation between value-leaks and imperfections on the one hand, and value-leaks and non-normal form process models on the other hand.
   The case study provides a concrete project in the social ecosystem of a large-scale municipality. What emerged initially as a simple cost-cutting exercise resulted at the end in a redesigned customer contact handling process, whereby both the customers and the employees were satisfied, and realizing also the cost reductions in a creative way by investigating the value-leaks.

AB Use of technologies in service encounters can enhance service delivery and increase customer satisfaction in services. Our research develops a numerical taxonomy that provides a deeper understanding of usage and value of customer-facing technology-based innovations in the U.S. restaurant industry. In this study, utility is a proxy for intrinsic customer value. Usage was estimated by past visits to restaurants and utility was calculated by using a specific type of discrete choice experiment known as Best-Worst (or max-diff) experiment. We offer insights for service strategy technology choices and customer value in service delivery systems research and practice. Furthermore, we advance service science by discussing the inherent management pitfalls of failing to distinguish between technology usage and utility in services.

AB This paper aims to develop a service value network analysis approach based on system dynamics (SD) for analyzing the feedback structures that causes dynamic behavior of service value networks for value co-creation. The proposed approach defines the network objectives, identifies network actors and their interactions, builds SD models, conducts model tests, and evaluates possible policies that can be used to enhance the overall network performance. A case study of Taiwan's mobile application services is used to illustrate the developed methodology. The developed methodology can help managers represent complex interactions and feedback structures of the service systems for value co-creation. In addition, decision makers can use the models to evaluate alternative scenarios for better understanding the system behavior that can improve the policy design and evaluation. Finally, we recommend that the case company should sense the market development of mobile application services continuously and improve its service quality on both user and developer sides relentlessly for sustaining its market growth.

AB Coteaching offers a model for the school-placement element of pre-service science teacher education, based on its demonstrated positive impacts on lessening classroom anxiety, supporting inquiry-based science teaching, improving students' attitudes, and addressing diversity effectively in science classrooms. Coteaching between pre-service and in-service teachers is used to lessen the gap between theory and practice, to develop reflective practice and to develop pedagogical content knowledge. Explanatory frameworks have been proposed for coteaching, and we suggest that Vygotsky's zone of proximal development helps to propose a more nuanced developmental and learning explanatory framework which provides pedagogical structures for implementation and highlights the importance of the social environment for learning. In providing structure and tools for effective implementation of coteaching, our model addresses three core elements of coteaching: coplanning, copractice, and coevaluation. The model was piloted in relation to pre-service teachers' development in reflective practice and reducing the gap between theory and classroom practice.

AB The Current study investigated the effect of the 5E learning cycle in which the simulations were integrated on pre-service science teachers' achievement in photoelectric subject. Four sophomore level classes with their 140 students participated in the research and a quasi-experimental design was used. The classes were randomly assigned into one of the two treatment groups. The experimental group (n1=69, male=16, female=53) studied photoelectric effect with the developed instruction and the control group (n2=71, male=19, female=52) studied the same subject with traditional instruction. Achievement test and open-ended exam were administered to measure students' pre-and-post achievements. The main effect of treatment on post-tests scores was examined via MANCOVA with pre-achievement scores used as covariate. The analyses yielded significant treatment effect on the collective dependent variables. Follow up ANCOVA results indicated that the instruction developed for the experimental group affected participants' post-achievement and post-open-ended exam scores significantly. Extensive analyses of the open-ended exam items showed that some of the participants were considering the supplied potential as the preliminary condition for the current flow in photocell circuit. The instructors or researchers would develop their treatments by integrating scientifically well-developed simulations into 5E learning cycle and use them in their lessons to promote learners' achievements.

AB This study describes a distance learning professional development program that we designed for the purpose of training science teachers to teach for creativity. The Moodle platform was used to host the training. To ensure that trainees would benefit from this distance learning program, we designed the instructional activities according to the Community of Inquiry framework, which consists of three main elements: cognitive presence, teaching presence and social presence. Nineteen science teachers in Oman engaged in the training, which lasted for 36 working days. To measure the effectiveness of the training program on science teachers' instructional practices related to teaching for creativity, we used a pre-post one-group quasi-experimental design. An observation form was used to assess and document participants' practices. Paired t test results showed that there was a statistically significant improvement in science teachers' practices related to teaching for creativity. During the implementation of the training program, we observed that cognitive presence and teaching presence were the two most successful elements of the program. The training program involved participants in different instructional activities which were designed to help them understand the role of creativity in science; a wide range of instructional techniques designed to nurture students' creativity was discussed. The program also provided participants with opportunities to relate their practices to teaching for creativity and to design and implement lesson plans geared toward teaching for creativity. However, the social presence element was not satisfying. Participants' virtual interactions with each other and their engagement in online discussion forums were limited. This paper provides some recommendations to overcome such pitfalls.

AB This study investigated the understanding of diffusion, osmosis and particle theory of matter concepts among 192 pre-service science teachers in Saudi Arabia using a 17-item two-tier multiple-choice diagnostic test. The data analysis showed that the pre-service teachers' understanding of osmosis and diffusion concepts was mildly correlated with their understanding of particle theory. We also identified 18 common alternative conceptions in these topics. The findings suggest that greater time and attention needs to be invested in the teaching of particle theory for Saudi pre-service teachers to ensure their scientific understanding of diffusion and osmosis concepts, so that they can help students understand the concepts better.

AB The paper is rooted in the recent Service Science line of research focused on the notion of 'T-shaped' knowledge. To the aim of theoretically and conceptually discuss the knowledge endowment required to a 'T-shaped' innovator, focus is on the notion of dynamic capabilities as characterizing the human side of service innovation. After a short introduction (Section 1), a model of the affirmation of the knowledge economy and the emergence of the consequent need for T-shaped innovators according to an escalation framework is presented (Section 2). Then, on the basis of the interpretation of T-shaped knowledge developed by adopting a Viable Systems Approach ((VSA)) perspective, conceptual links between the notions of incremental and radical innovation, on the one hand, and of capabilities and competences, on the other hand, are explored (Section 3). The paper findings provide a taxonomy of T-shaped innovators' capabilities that turn out to be more and more crucial to develop innovation in a context of growing complexity (Section 4). Finally, it moves on to discuss the organizational and technological aspects of management of T-shaped innovators (Section 5), outlining some managerial implications and future research paths (Section 6).

AB Progress in ecosystem service science has been rapid, and there is now a healthy appetite among key public and private sector decision makers for this science. However, changing policy and management is a long-term project, one that raises a number of specific practical challenges. One impediment to broad adoption of ecosystem service information is the lack of standards that define terminology, acceptable data and methods, and reporting requirements. Ecosystem service standards should be tailored to specific use contexts, such as national income and wealth accounts, corporate sustainability reporting, land-use planning, and environmental impact assessments. Many standard-setting organizations already exist, and the research community will make the most headway toward rapid uptake of ecosystem service science by working directly with these organizations. Progress has been made in aligning with existing organizations in areas such as product certification and sustainability reporting, but a major challenge remains in mainstreaming ecosystem service information into core public and private use contexts, such as agricultural and energy subsidy design, national income accounts, and corporate accounts.

AB This paper is the first exploratory and quantitative study on a global scale of the current and future impact of ISO 20000, a standard that is forecast to play an important role in the information technology service management field. For the analysis of the current situation, this article first describes this standard and other related standards. This is followed by a diffusion analysis using worldwide certification data. It also analyses geographical distribution by continents and countries and examines its evolution over time through comparison with other management-system standards. The analysis extends to the relationships existing between countries, and a clear correlation is detected between different countries regarding the number of certifications and certification intensity. Regarding future forecasts, a logistic curve is used to detect the theoretical saturation point, which is earlier than previously thought. Therefore, and comparing it with an updated forecast for other parallel standards (viz: ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001), the analysis presents a new scenario in the field of management-system standardisation.

AB Background: Self-monitoring (self-testing and self-management) could be a valid option for oral anticoagulation therapy monitoring in the NHS, but current evidence on its clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness is limited.
   Objectives: We investigated the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of point-of-care coagulometers for the self-monitoring of coagulation status in people receiving long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy, compared with standard clinic monitoring. Data sources: We searched major electronic databases (e.g. MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Bioscience Information Service, Science Citation Index and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) from 2007 to May 2013. Reports published before 2007 were identified from the existing Cochrane review (major databases searched from inception to 2007). The economic model parameters were derived from the clinical effectiveness review, other relevant reviews, routine sources of cost data and clinical experts' advice. Review methods: We assessed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating self-monitoring in people with atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease requiring long-term anticoagulation therapy. CoaguChek (R) XS and S models (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), INRatio2 (R) PT/INR monitor (Alere Inc., San Diego, CA USA), and ProTime Microcoagulation system (R) (International Technidyne Corporation, Nexus Dx, Edison, NJ, USA) coagulometers were compared with standard monitoring. Where possible, we combined data from included trials using standard inverse variance methods. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A de novo economic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness over a 10-year period.
   Results: We identified 26 RCTs (published in 45 papers) with a total of 8763 participants. CoaguChek was used in 85% of the trials. Primary analyses were based on data from 21 out of 26 trials. Only four trials were at low risk of bias. Major clinical events: self-monitoring was significantly better than standard monitoring in preventing thromboembolic events [relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.84; p = 0.004]. In people with artificial heart valves (AHVs), self-monitoring almost halved the risk of thromboembolic events (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.82; p = 0.003) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92; p = 0.02). There was greater reduction in thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality through self-management but not through self-testing. Intermediate outcomes: self-testing, but not self-management, showed a modest but significantly higher percentage of time in therapeutic range, compared with standard care (weighted mean difference 4.44, 95% CI 1.71 to 7.18; p = 0.02). Patient-reported outcomes: improvements in patients' quality of life related to self-monitoring were observed in six out of nine trials. High preference rates were reported for self-monitoring (77% to 98% in four trials). Net health and social care costs over 10 years were 7295 pound (self-monitoring with INRatio2); 7324 pound (standard care monitoring); 7333 pound (self-monitoring with CoaguChek XS) and 8609 pound (self-monitoring with ProTime). The estimated quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain associated with self-monitoring was 0.03. Self-monitoring with INRatio2 or CoaguChek XS was found to have approximate to 80% chance of being cost-effective, compared with standard monitoring at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY gained.
   Conclusions: Compared with standard monitoring, self-monitoring appears to be safe and effective, especially for people with AHVs. Self-monitoring, and in particular self-management, of anticoagulation status appeared cost-effective when pooled estimates of clinical effectiveness were applied. However, if self-monitoring does not result in significant reductions in thromboembolic events, it is unlikely to be cost-effective, based on a comparison of annual monitoring costs alone. Trials investigating the longer-term outcomes of self-management are needed, as well as direct comparisons of the various point-of-care coagulometers.

TI Health Care Delivery Meets Hospitality: A Pilot Study in Radiology
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY

DT Article
DE Patient experience; hospitality; health care delivery
ID PATIENT SATISFACTION; SERVICES
AB The patient experience has moved to the forefront of health care-delivery research. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Department of Diagnostic Radiology began collaborating in 2011 with the University of Houston Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, and in 2013 with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration, to explore the application of service science to improving the patient experience. A collaborative pilot study was undertaken by these 3 institutions to identify and rank the specific needs and expectations of patients undergoing imaging procedures in the MD Anderson Department of Diagnostic Radiology. We first conducted interviews with patients, providers, and staff to identify factors perceived to affect the patient experience. Next, to confirm these factors and determine their relative importance, we surveyed more than 6,000 patients by e-mail. All factors considered important in the interviews were confirmed as important in the surveys. The surveys showed that the most important factors were acknowledgment of the patient's concerns, being treated with respect, and being treated like a person, not a "number"; these factors were more important than privacy, short waiting times, being able to meet with a radiologist, and being approached by a staff member versus having one's name called out in the waiting room. Our work shows that it is possible to identify and rank factors affecting patient satisfaction using techniques employed by the hospitality industry. Such factors can be used to measure and improve the patient experience.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine pre-service and in-service science and mathematics teachers. perceptions of the characteristics of a professional teaching environment. The study further investigated the relationships of field placement contexts and grade levels on pre-service teachers. perceptions of importance and availability of certain aspects of a professional teaching environment. The teacher perceptions were assessed using the Professional Environment for Teaching Survey (PETS). The responses reflecting the teacher perceptions of importance were subjected to a principal component analysis and two components were identified. These were Resources for Teaching and Recognition of Teacher Contributions. Data obtained from pre-service teachers who (were) enrolled in a graduate teacher education licensure program at a large Midwestern university and from in-service teachers who were mentors for the pre-service teachers. Correlation and forward stepwise multiple regression analyses of the data suggested that the perceptions of importance and/or availability of those pre-service or in-service teachers with more experience were related to the academic degree they held and the content that they were teaching or expecting to teach. Results for the in-service and pre-service teachers. perceptions were discussed in terms of characteristics of a professional teaching environment.

ID SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; DOMINANT LOGIC; CREATION
AB This paper proposes an anthropology of services with implications for service science and design. Contemporary services are often presented as a rupture with previous economic regimes such as manufacturing, a discontinuity that allows services to be conceptualized as a professional domain. We argue instead that services have long characterized the human condition and that they are always embedded in local contexts. An anthropology of services explicates these social contexts to develop more varied and grounded approaches to service encounters, notions of co-production and co-creation, value propositions and service systems. Paradoxically, an anthropology of services draws attention to the conceptual and methodological messiness of service worlds and in doing so it contributes to expanding our understanding of the variety of services, the limits to their conceptualization as objects of design and the possibilities for intervening in and around them to contribute to human betterment.

DE pre-service teacher; field experience; Thailand; action research
AB As a key element in teacher education programmes, action research is a learning process in which pre-service teachers inquire, reflect on and improve their teaching practices. This qualitative study sought to understand what enhanced or hindered Thai pre-service teachers' action research projects during their student teaching. This study drew upon written reflections, focus-group interviews and observations of seminar sessions. Data analysis was inductive, involving categorical aggregation followed by a search for correspondence and patterns. The results indicated that the pre-service teachers misunderstood action research, and also held a negative attitude toward it, both of which led them to superficial analyses of practice. They struggled with time limitations, data gathering and interpretation strategies. In spite of the struggles they experienced, these pre-service science teachers did learn more about the action research through collaboratively working with cooperating teachers and university supervisors and on-campus seminar discussions held concurrently with the fifth year internship. Recognizing and understanding the reasons and thinking patterns at the root of these teachers' difficulties with learning about action research can form the basis for reflecting on and rethinking the components of science teacher preparation programmes in Thailand.

ID FIELD
AB Background:Today, for most of us, technology is a vital and inevitable part of our lives. Due to its widespread use, a great emphasis is being given to educating generations about technology. And, every individual has his/her own style of organizing and collecting information.Purpose:The purpose of the present study is to identify the relationship between pre-service science teachers' cognitive styles and their cognitive structures about technology.Sample:The study was conducted with the participation of first and third grade pre-service science teachers majoring in Science Education in the Faculty of Education at Abant zzet Baysal University in the spring semester of 2012-2013.Design and methods:The study was designed as a case study and a qualitative research method was used. Students were administered two instruments: Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and a Word Association Test (WAT).Results:Results clearly suggested that the first grade participants with a field-dependent cognitive style were better at associating concepts when compared to those with a field-independent cognitive style. And, participants with a field-dependent style, could form more connections between the technology-related concepts. A comparison of the findings on the field-dependent participants by their grade demonstrated that the first and third grade participants with a field-dependent cognitive style got similar scores in terms of the total number of words generated for each key concept.Conclusions:Considering that education is for individuals, it is impossible to ignore individual differences during the process. The most interesting finding of the present study is that field-dependent individuals have a higher cognitive structure, unlike that which has been asserted so far in the literature.

AB Service research in information systems (IS) has received attention over many years. This study probes into the development of service science, management, and engineering literatures through the perspective of bibliometrics under IS. Data were based on the science social citation index, from the Institute of Scientific Information Web of Science database. A total of 4,513 entries in a span of 22 years from 1991 to 2012 were collected. This paper implemented and classified service science, service management, and SE articles using the following publication type and language, characteristics of articles outputs, country, subject categories and journals, and the frequency of title-words and keywords used. Also, the paper performs the K-S test to check whether the distribution of author article production follows Lotka's law. Meanwhile, the analysis indicated the most relevant disciplines for SSME subject category provided by business economics, information science and library science, and computer science.

AB The digital divide is usually conceptualized through goods-dominant logic, where bridging the divide entails providing digital goods to disadvantaged segments of the population. This is expected to enhance their digital capabilities and thus to have a positive influence on the digital outcomes (or services) experienced. In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education. This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries. The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society. But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources. Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated. Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined. The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources-knowledge, technology, and institutions-through which value-creating user-centric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved. The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement. The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage. Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations: obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration.

AB The unprecedented scale of Information Technology (IT) service delivery requires careful analysis and optimization of service systems. The simulation is an efficient way to handle the complexity of modeling and optimization of real-world service delivery systems. However, typically developed custom simulation models lack standard architectures and limit the reuse of design and implementation artifacts across multiple models. In this work, following the design science research methodology, based on a formal model of service delivery systems and applying an adapted software product line (SPL) approach, we create a design artifact for building product lines of IT service delivery simulation models, which vastly simplify and reduce the cost of simulation model design and development. We evaluate the design artifact by constructing a product line of simulation models for a set of IBM's IT service delivery systems. We validate the proposed approach by comparing the simulation results obtained using our models with the results from the corresponding custom simulation models. The case study demonstrates that the proposed approach leads to 5-8 times reductions in the time required to design and develop related simulation models. The potential implications of the application of the proposed approach within an organization are quicker responses to changes in the business environment, more information to assist in managerial decisions, and reduced workload on the process reengineering specialists.

AB Existing research on service supply chains assumes the existence of an established and mature chain. Empirical or conceptual insights into service supply chain formation are therefore limited. The initial formation of a service supply chain, however, is suspected to determine its future performance. It is therefore of significant academic and managerial value to understand how and why service supply chains are formed, and how this process is coordinated. Drawing on an exploratory case study set in the management consulting industry, the inductive theory-building process underlying this study culminates in propositions and a conceptual model that provides a distinct understanding of service supply chain formation and the coordination mechanisms utilized within each stage. This study contributes to the service science, service supply chains, and service sourcing literatures; outlines managerial implications; and proposes future research directions.

AB The present study is based on identification and elimination of several misconceptions of university level students regarding chemistry topics. For this reason, the static-group pre-test-post-test design was implemented with 52 teacher candidates. Regarding the content of the study, the experimental group participants opted for "Misconceptions in Science" course whereas the control group selected "Physics in environment" course in terms of elective courses. Data was collected through a form which consisted of 3 open-ended statements during the research process. In addition, an evaluation form was prepared to determine the opinions of the experimental group on the course. As a result of the study, the pre-test analyses revealed several misconceptions which all the participants have, whereas the post-test results indicated that "Misconceptions in science" course was effective in the elimination of experimental group's misconceptions. Also, the course was found to be necessary and efficient. Delayed post-test results justified the resistivity of the misconceptions of the experimental group members, although they had been performing their jobs as in-service science teachers.

AB The relationship between cognitive structure outcomes of students and their test achievement was examined in this study. A question form and two types of tests (a multiple-choice test (MCT) and a true-false test (TFT)) were used to gather the research data. According to the results of this study, extend, richness and integratedness of students' statements significantly correlated to their scores in TFT. Also, richness of students' statements was significantly correlated to their MCT scores. Describing and comparing were significantly correlated with MCT scores, while describing, comparing and inferring were significantly correlated with the students' TFT scores. Therefore, it can be said that tests reflect students' cognitive structures. Furthermore, students with higher order thinking skills can be identified by TFT rather than with MCT. Students' misconceptions about the research topic were also examined, and they were generally on the classification and types of chemical bonds.

AB In this study were investigated the opinions of pre-service science teachers about some ethical principles and their moral values that were acknowledged by them. For this purpose, this study has been carried out with pre-service science teachers (N = 275). Ethical opinions were solicited using a questionnaire which was developed based on a literature review and considering the opinions of experts. The Ethical Position Questionnaire (EPQ) for the purpose of determining moral values was also used. It was recognised that the pre-service science teachers, in several regions have relativistic ideas about their moral values. At the same time, participants from the Mediterranean region, Central Anatolia and South-Eastern Anatolia have idealist opinions. In the assessment of moral values for teachers in terms of their gender, it may be concluded that females had more idealistic opinions than males. This study is important not only in terms of increasing the awareness of pre-service science teachers about ethical issues, but also for drawing conclusions from the overall results.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop computer-assisted instruction (CAI) material about fossil fuels based on constructivist learning theory and evaluate its effectiveness. The study was conducted via quasi-experimental research design. The sample of the study consisted of 46 third grade pre-service science teachers (PSTs) studying in Elementary Science Teaching Department and taking 'Special Topics in Chemistry' course. In the light of findings obtained, while the participants in the experimental group explain fossil fuels mentioning their formation process, the participants in the control group define fossil fuels as source of energy or fuel/kind of fuel. The PSTs who explained that fossil fuels were used as the source of energy stated that they used fossil fuels mainly for heating and transportation. The PSTs stated that using fossil fuels caused air/environmental pollution, acid rains, depletion of ozone layer, and global warming and they made some suggestions in order to prevent the occurrence of these problems. There is a difference between the PSTs pre-test and post-test results regarding their definitions of fossil fuels, how to use them as the source of energy and their effects on environment. It can be stated that awareness was developed about the use of fossil fuels in favour of experimental group.

AB The purpose of the present study is to investigate the pre-service science teachers perception of greenhouse effect in terms of its effects, causes and possible solutions on the basis of the variables of gender, grade level and the state of whether taking an environmental course or not. The study is a descriptive study designed in the survey model. It was conducted with the participation of 90 first-year and fourth-year students selected through random sampling from among the students attending the Department of Science Teaching at the Education Faculty of Mugla Sitki Kocman University in 2013-2014 academic year. As data collection instruments, an Information Form and the Greenhouse Effect Scale were employed. It was found that the pre-service science teachers opinions about the possible solutions of greenhouse effect do not vary significantly depending on gender, grade level and the state of whether taking an environmental course or not; yet, the opinions about the causes of greenhouse effect vary significantly depending on these variables. While their opinions about the effects of greenhouse effect vary significantly depending on gender, they do not depend on grade level and the state of whether taking an environmental course or not.

AB Science teaching emerged due to an attempt to understand the world around us and a sense of wonder at nature and survived until today by means of being supported by new research and findings. The implementation of science in schools is carried out with curriculums. The main purpose of the curriculum of science courses is to train all students in science literacy regardless of their individual differences. According to the educational program of sciences courses, audiovisual aids used in education with a learning objective which is one of these aids is one of the most effective ways to ensure permanent learning. Within this concept the purpose of the study is to determine the opinions of pre-service science teachers about the curriculum of the science lesson based upon the stories in the 3-Idiots movie. In this research, phenomenology research was used. As a data gathering tool, three semi-structured interview questions prepared accordingly to "3-Idiots" movie were used. According to the participants, the science curriculum must be lead in investigating, interrogating, criticising, curiosity and reconnoitering in terms of features that must be acquired for being scientifically literate individuals.

With this purpose in this research atom concept is conveyed to the classroom milieu through observations and experiments related to the atom concept during historical development process starting with the masterpiece of, the carrier of the atom thoughts of Antiquity to our age, Roman philosopher Lucretius, namely De Rerum Natura. The study has conducted thoughts regarding the atom in ancient and subsequent history under six headings teaching modules that would span over 11 weeks. The participants in the study were 73 pre-service science teachers. The two-tier multiple-choice diagnostic test was developed. In the analysis of the results of the test, after test hypotheses were proved, the single-factor ANOVA was employed for related samples, while frequency analysis was used for the content of the views of the participants and percentages were calculated to observe the change in alternative conceptions.

AB One of the most necessary teaching competencies for science teachers concerns their self-efficacy belief. It is also necessary for teachers to benefit from educational research in order to develop their science teaching efficacy beliefs. However, studies are restricted. This study aims to analyze the attitudes of pre-service science teachers towards educational research and their science teaching efficacy beliefs, and the relationship between the two variables according to some demographical (academic achievement, gender, and the type of high school they attended). The study was conducted according to the survey research design. Sample of the study includes 517 pre-service science teachers (final year students) at five different universities in Turkey. 'Teachers Attitude Scale towards Educational Research [TASTER]' and 'Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument [STEBI]' were used as data collection tools. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. Analysis of the data has revealed that there is a relationship between the attitudes of the pre-service science teachers towards educational research and their science teaching efficacy belief.

DE IBSE; in-service teachers in Georgia; professional development; stages
   of concern
AB Decreasing motivation in science classes is often reported in many countries. Georgia, one of the post Soviet countries, has overcome the highly centralised educational system and nowadays implements a new national educational reform. National reforms demand more student-active and inquiry-based learning. Many Georgian teachers aren't ready for these changes and need professional development training to enhance their professional skills in Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE). Therefore Ilia State University offers special continuous professional development (CPD) programs for science teachers in the frame of PROFILES project. The aim of the research was to determine what profession oriented attitudes and concerns Georgian in-service science teachers have regarding IBSE and what changes are visible after the implementation of PROFILES-based CPD programme. In order to conduct the research, the Stages of Concern model was used. 40 teachers took part in the two terms of the CPD programme. Research shows that the implemented CPD programme fosters the professional attitudes and concerns of Georgian science teachers in a positive manner. Therefore, it can be highly recommended to use the framework of the PROFILES-based CPD programme(s).

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of argument-driven inquiry (ADI) based laboratory instruction on the academic achievement, argumentativeness, science process skills, and argumentation levels of pre-service science teachers in the General Physics Laboratory III class. The study was conducted with 79 pre-service science teachers. The participants in the control group (n = 38) participated in traditional laboratory activities, and the participants in the experimental group (n = 41) participated in laboratory activities based on argument-driven inquiry. Data was collected through the Optical Achievement Test (OAT), Argumentative Scale (AS), Science Process Skills Test (SPST) and the individual reports of the participants. Qualitative and quantitative techniques were used together to analyze the data. The results showed that argument-driven inquiry was more effective in improving the academic achievement and science process skills of pre-service science teachers compared to traditional laboratory instruction, but no significant difference was observed in the Argumentative Scale scores between the groups that had ADI instruction and those that had traditional laboratory instruction. Towards the end of the treatment, there was an improvement in the argumentative quality of the experimental group, but there was no change in the argumentation quality of the control group. ADI is an effective method for improving the academic achievement and science process skills of students, and it could be adapted for other laboratory classes. Argumentativeness might be improved with a longer argumentation session and more laboratory activities.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine environmental moral reasoning patterns of 120 pre-service science teachers together with the effects of gender and grade level on these reasoning. For data collection, participants were asked to write their concerns about four environmental problems (i.e., deforestation, electronic waste, oil spills, global warming) each of which were presented as local and global cases. Content analysis was performed on the participants' written statements and frequencies of the statements reflecting ecocentric, anthropocentric, and non-environmental moral reasoning were calculated to be used in descriptive and inferential analyses. While analyses did not reveal statistically significant difference between environmental moral reasoning patterns of males and females, grade level was found to have statistically significant effect. In addition to general patterns in pre-service science teachers' environmental moral reasoning, findings were also interpreted for local and global environmental problem dichotomy. Implications for environmental education were discussed.

AB Service-dominant (S-D) logic is a service science framework that is more robust than the traditional goods-dominant (G-D) logic. It emphasizes the importance of operant resources and value Cocreation. This study employs social cognitive theory to explore the triple reciprocity of organizational value Cocreation behavior. Further, this study uses DEMATEL-based ANP to examine the dynamic nature of organizational value Cocreation behavior. The major results of this study can be described as follows. First, the triadic reciprocity of personal, environmental, and behavioral factors are validated. Second, the dominant influencing trends are clearly identified. From a dimensional point of view, environmental factors affect personal factors and behavioral factors, and personal factors affect behavioral factors. Similarly, in terms of organizational value Cocreation behavior, organizational identification affects altruistic behavior and knowledge-sharing behavior, and altruistic behavior affects knowledge-sharing behavior. These findings may provide helpful guidance in effectively promoting organizational value cocreation behavior, enabling organizations to leverage operant resources to their maximum potential.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a service-dominant (S-D) logic-based input-output analysis approach to systematically measure the effects of technology spillover in the service sector.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a case to demonstrate the feasibility and contributions of the S-D logic-based input-output analysis approach.
   Findings - This study adopted the idea of customer involvement to formulate the S-D logic-based input-output analysis approach. Service providers can apply this systematical approach to find potential opportunities to spread information technology and co-create values with customers.
   Originality/value - The S-D logic-based input-output analysis approach has elasticity to dynamically employ different perspectives to evaluate the effects of technology spillovers in order for integrity and precision. The proposed approach is to delineate the possible target values that related to specific services based on the notions of operant resources and customer involvement in a selected service sector. Service providers within the service sector have to offer innovative service activities and manage existing services for customers to participate in.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate how a mixed-method case study affects pre-service science teachers' awareness of hexavalent chromium pollution and content knowledge about the properties of chromium's different oxidation states. The study was conducted in Turkey with 55 sophomores during the fall semester of 2013-2014. The students were taught using a case study about chromium's properties, the qualitative and quantitative analysis methods used with chromium compounds, the effects of chromium compounds on human health, and the chemical techniques that can be used to remove hexavalent chromium from wastewater. Open-ended questions were applied to determine the students' pre- and post-knowledge before and after instruction. An open-ended questionnaire and semi-structured interviews showed that the case study had a positive effect on all participants in terms of increasing their awareness of the hazardous effects of hexavalent chromium. Pair sample and independent sample t-test results revealed that the presenting and the audience groups significantly increased their content knowledge after instruction. On the other hand, while there was no statistically significant difference between the groups on verbal questions, there was a difference between the presenting and the audience groups on calculative questions. This finding shows that the mixed-method case instruction might not have affected all subjects in the same way.

AB This study investigates pre-service teachers' capacities to attend to, analyze, and respond to student thinking. Using a performance assessment of teacher competence, we compare two cohorts of science teacher candidates, one that participated in a video-based course designed to develop these skills and one that did not. Course participants demonstrate more sophisticated levels of attention to and analysis of student ideas. Analysis of the relationship among skills reveals that sophisticated analyses and responses to student ideas require high sophistication in attending to student ideas. However, high sophistication in attending to student ideas does not guarantee more sophisticated analyses or responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present article aimed at understanding those unvoiced biases pre-service teachers may have that conflicts with their integration of nature of science in their science lessons. Three senior pre-service science teachers. views on NOS with regard to their decision making on critical incidents and their reflections about how they contextualize science teaching were investigated in science method course. The findings indicated that, pre-service science teachers varied in reflective their nature of science understanding in different contexts related to their science teaching approach. Therefore, current study suggested that efforts to improve science teachers' nature of science views and practice need to consider science teachers. unvoiced biases such as their approach towards science teaching and their decision making related to science teaching.

AB This paper examines the effects of information and communication technology (ICT) service innovation and its complementary strategies on brand equity and customer loyalty toward ICT service providers. We draw from research on brand equity and customer loyalty, ICT innovation management, and strategy complementarity to propose a model that includes new constructs representing ICT service innovation, i.e., service leadership, and its two complementary strategies, i.e., customization-personalization control and technology leadership, and how their interactions influence customer loyalty through customer-based brand equity. We test our model using data from an online survey of 1,210 customers of mobile data services. The results show that service leadership and customization-personalization control have significant direct impacts on ICT service providers' brand equity. Moreover, when either the level of technology leadership or the level of customization-personalization control is high, the impact of service leadership on brand equity is enhanced. In turn, brand equity has significant impacts on consumers' affective loyalty and conative loyalty, but not on cognitive loyalty. Our study contributes to the literature on service management and service science, and in particular to the management of ICT service innovation in a consumer technology market.

AB This study aims to shed light on the process of building an effective smart city by integrating various practical perspectives with a consideration of smart city characteristics taken from the literature. We developed a framework for conducting case studies examining how smart cities were being implemented in San Francisco and Seoul Metropolitan City. The study's empirical results suggest that effective, sustainable smart cities emerge as a result of dynamic processes in which public and private sector actors coordinate their activities and resources on an open innovation platform. The different yet complementary linkages formed by these actors must further be aligned with respect to their developmental stage and embedded cultural and social capabilities. Our findings point to eight 'stylized facts', based on both quantitative and qualitative empirical results that underlie the facilitation of an effective smart city. In elaborating these facts, the paper offers useful insights to managers seeking to improve the delivery of smart city developmental projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Heavy equipment manufacturing firms are increasingly challenged by the integration of service planning and execution in their established product-centred information systems (IS) environment. Despite a few standardisation efforts, there is no common understanding of service systems in industry goods companies and the corresponding requirements for the appropriation of information systems. We address this need by developing a maturity model. The design of the model is grounded in extant literature, focus group and case study research involving eleven organisations over 1.5 years. The evaluation confirms that the maturity model makes a novel and useful contribution to the design of service systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: A meta-analysis of empirical studies performed in Korea was conducted to systematically investigate the associations between the indices of Internet addiction (IA) and psychosocial variables. Materials and Methods: Systematic literature searches were carried out using the Korean Studies Information Service System, Research Information Sharing Service, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and references in review articles. The key words were Internet addiction, (Internet) game addiction, and pathological, problematic, and excessive Internet use. Only original research papers using Korean samples published from 1999 to 2012 and officially reviewed by peers were included for analysis. Ninety-five studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Results: The magnitude of the overall effect size of the intrapersonal variables associated with Internet addiction was significantly higher than that of interpersonal variables. Specifically, IA demonstrated a medium to strong association with "escape from self' and "self-identity" as selfrelated variables. "Attention problem", "self-control", and "emotional regulation" as control and regulation-relation variables; "addiction and absorption traits" as temperament variables; "anger" and "aggression" as emotion and mood and variables; "negative stress coping" as coping variables were also associated with comparably larger effect sizes. Contrary to our expectation, the magnitude of the correlations between relational ability and quality, parental relationships and family functionality, and IA were found to be small. The strength of the association between IA and the risk and protective factors was found to be higher in younger age groups. Conclusion: The findings highlight a need for closer examination of psychosocial factors, especially intrapersonal variables when assessing high-risk individuals and designing intervention strategies for both general IA and Internet game addiction.

AB Vee diagrams have been a metacognitive tool to help in learning the nature and structure of knowledge by reflecting on the scientific process and making knowledge much more explicit to learners during the practical work. This study aimed to assess pre-service science teachers. understanding some aspects of NOS by analyzing their reflections on the Vee diagrams constructed during the general biology laboratory course. In this single case study, elementary pre-service science teachers who cited mainly "the cell theory" in their Vee diagrams while building around the cell concepts were asked to participate in focus group reflective interviews. These interviews compared the patterns of the nature of scientific knowledge to the ways their constructed the cell related concepts. The content analysis of transcripts revealed that pre-service teachers gained a superficial understanding of history of scientific ideas in the development of the cell biology, not a deeper epistemological understanding in conceptualizing a contemporary understanding of the aspects of NOS. The emergent categories of naive understandings and misconceptions held by the participants were demonstrated and discussed in the light of NOS related literature.

AB Nowadays, the importance given to astronomy teaching in science and physics education has been gradually increasing. At the same time, teachers play an important role in remediating the misconceptions about astronomy concepts held by students. The present study aims to determine the misconceptions of pre-service physics teachers (n=117), pre-service science teachers (n=97) and in-service physics teachers (n=174) about astronomy concepts using a three-tier test. The Astronomy Concept and Achievement Test (ACAT), developed by Trumper (2001a, 2001b, 2006), was adapted as a three-tier instrument and used as the data collection instrument. The first tier, first and second tier and all three tier responses that were obtained from the ACAT were analyzed separately to identify misconceptions and to evaluate the respondents. achievement. The results showed that the achievement scores of pre-service and in-service teachers considerably decreased when the third tier was considered. In addition, when the misconceptions of pre-service and in-service teachers were determined using all three tiers, they held extensive misconceptions especially about the reasons for seasons, the Moon's phases, the Moon's phase in the solar eclipse and the Sun's position in the sky.

AB This study investigated the relationship between pre-service science teachers. written argumentation levels about socio-scientific issues and epistemic belief levels in an online discussion environment. A mixed-methods approach was used: 30 Turkish pre-service science teachers contributed with their written argumentations to four socio-scientific issues. The pre-service science teachers. argumentations were evaluated by an adapted version of argumentation analysis framework developed by Sadler and Fowler (2006) and their epistemic belief levels were measured using the Epistemic Belief Questionnaire by Kuhn, Cheney, and Weinstock (2000). The qualitative as well as quantitative results indicated that: (1) the pre-service science teachers produced high-level argumentations for each socio-scientific issue in an online discussion environment, (2) levels of argumentations increased from climate change to human genome project issue, and (3) higher-level argumentations were produced for higher epistemic belief levels (i.e., multiplist and evaluativist).

AB Despite much progress in ecosystem services research, a gap still appears to exist between this research and the implementation of landscape management and development activities on the ground, especially within a developing country context. If ecosystem service science is to be operationalised and used by decision-makers directing local development, an in-depth understanding of the implementation context for landscape planning and management, and of the opportunities and challenges for ecosystem services in this context are needed. Very little is known about these opportunities and constraints, largely because of the absence of methods to explore the complexity of the landscape planning, management and implementation context and the possibilities of integrating scientific information into these processes within a real-world setting. This study aims to address this need for information and methods, by focusing on a region in South Africa with a long history of ecosystem service research and stakeholder engagement, and testing a social science approach to explore opportunities and challenges for integrating ecosystem services in landscape planning processes and policies. Our methodological approach recognises the importance of social processes and legitimacy in decision-making, emphasizing the need to engage with the potential end-users of ecosystem service research in order to ensure the relevance of the research. While we discovered challenges for mainstreaming ecosystem service at a local level, we also found strong opportunities in the multi-sectoral planning processes driving development and in how the concept of ecosystem services is framed and aligned with development priorities, especially those relating to disaster risk reduction.

ID SCIENCE TEACHER-EDUCATION; INQUIRY; EXPERIENCES; COMMUNITIES; IDENTITY;

AB This article examines the influence of a practicum teaching experience on two pre-service science teachers. The research is focused on examining a practicum in a secondary science department that actively promotes the teaching and learning of science as inquiry. We investigated the process through which the pre-service science teachers integrated their practical knowledge, and examined this in the context of the quantified reformed instruction they enacted. Using a mixed methods design, we have quantified these pre-service science teachers' practice using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (Piburn et al. 2000), in concert with a narrative methodology drawn from in-depth interviews. Our analysis of the data indicates two important conclusions. The first is the importance of a consistently reformed image of science education being presented and practiced by both science teacher educators and cooperating teachers. The second is the recognition that a consistently reformed image may not be sufficient, of itself, to challenge pre-service teachers' views of science education. Pre-service teachers appear to be heavily influenced by their biographies and own science education. Consequently, it appears the extent to which a pre-service teacher identifies problems of teaching and learning, and then works toward possible resolution, influences their progress in shaping reformed views of science education.

AB Despite significant interest in value propositions, there is limited agreement about their nature and role. Moreover, there is little understanding of their application to today's increasingly interconnected and networked world. The purpose of this article is to explore the nature of value propositions, extending prior conceptualisations by taking a service ecosystem perspective. Following a critical review of the extant literature in service science on value propositions, value co-creation, service-dominant logic and networks and drawing on six metaphors that provide insights into the nature of value propositions, we develop a new conceptualisation. The role of value propositions is then explored in terms of resource offerings between actors within micro, meso and macro levels of service ecosystems. We illustrate these perspectives with two real-world exemplars. We describe the role of value propositions in an ecosystem as a shaper of resource offerings. Finally, we provide five key premises and outline a research agenda.

AB The quality of experience and quality of service provided in the healthcare sector are critical in evaluating the reliable delivery of the healthcare services provided. Medical images and videos play a major role in modern e-health services and have become an integral part of medical data communication systems. The quality evaluation of medical images and videos is an essential process, and one of the ways of addressing it is via the use of quality metrics. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art video quality metrics with respect to compressed medical ultrasound video sequences. We study the performance of each video quality metric in representing the diagnostic quality of the video, by evaluating the correlation of each metric with the subjective opinions of medical experts. The results indicate that the visual information fidelity, structural similarity index, and universal quality index metrics show good correlation with the subjective scores provided by medical experts. The tests also investigate the performance of the emerging video compression standard, high-efficiency video coding-HEVC, for medical ultrasound video compression. The results show that, using HEVC with the considered ultrasound video sequences, a diagnostically reliable compressed ultrasound video can be obtained for compression with values of the quantization parameter up to 35.

AB Conceptualizing, analyzing, and optimizing service productivity is imperative to build up and to sustain competitive advantage in today's global service economy. However, service productivity is yet to be thoroughly conceptualized and supported by IT artifacts so as to design, compute, and interpret meaningful productivity models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ontological expressiveness of conceptual modeling grammars for service productivity management. Due to a lack of a complete ontology for service productivity management, we compile evaluation criteria by reviewing authoritative theory. Against these criteria, a selection of conceptual modeling grammars is analyzed by reviewing the grammars' meta models for completeness. The analysis contributes two major insights. First, theory in productivity management appears equivocal and is too unspecific to guide the design of IT artifacts. Second, conceptual modeling grammars are subject to various ontological deficiencies with respect to service productivity management. Two core implications are identified. First, service productivity theories need to be refined as design theories in order to comprehensively inform the design of IT artifacts. Second, conceptual modeling grammars must be extended and aligned with each other.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between pre-service science teachers' Field Dependent or Field Independent (FD/FI) cognitive styles and the application of degrees of naive impetus theory. The sample consisted of 122 pre-service science teachers (97 females and 25 males) who were enrolled in the Introductory Physics course required by the Science Education program. Data were collected in two successive years, after the completion of the required Introductory Physics undergraduate courses, in 2008 and 2009. The Group Embedded Figure Test and Impetus Theory Application Test (a two-tier-type test) were administered to assess the FD/FI tendency of students and to determine the degree students applied the na < ve impetus theory, respectively. Initial results showed that a majority of students had made use of the native impetus theory repeatedly. The results also indicated that the degree to which students applied the na < ve impetus theory was statistically related to their FD/FI cognitive styles. The findings of this research showed that there existed a statistically significant difference between the FI and FD students' degree of applying the na < ve impetus theory in favor of FI students. However, the test score gap between FI and FD students remained almost constant regardless of the testing instruments utilized in this study.

AB This paper presents an investigation of the relationships between the factors that drive the adoption of integrated, web-based demand chain management (DCM), as well as the relationship between web-based DCM integration and service innovation performance. Data was collected from 256 companies in the health care industry. The results show that collaborative structure (e.g. competitive pressure, trust, information sharing and environmental uncertainty) and technological structure (e.g. security) have a positive and significant influence on an organization's decision to adopt web-based DCM integration. However, collaborative structure has the greatest influence by far on an organization's adoption of web-based DCM integration. The findings also show strong evidence that web-based DCM integration improves service innovation performance. We also found that web-based DCM implementation has a greater impact on service innovation performance than in organizations that only implement web-based supply or demand integration strategies. This research has important implications for organizations interested in improving their service innovation performance, as well as improving web-based DCM integration. For example, to improve the success of web-based DCM adoption, organizations should focus on improving their collaborative structure with suppliers and customers first, before considering their technological structure. Security is also a key issue that needs to be addressed by organizations to ensure the successful adoption of web-based DCM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This case study explored pre-service science students' approaches to studying and learning. The participants were 65 undergraduate students (females = 47%; age range 18 to 25 years) at a university of technology in South Africa. Students' preferences for deep or surface learning were evaluated using the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (Biggs, Kember & Leung, 2001). Data were analysed to contrast learning motive and strategy by year of university placement. The difference in the use of deep as compared to surface motives was higher among students with senior level placement (third years) than their peers with junior placement (second years). Deep motives may be more serviceable with the more rigorous learning expected with senior level education placement.

AB Professor Leonard Kleinrock has made key contributions during the initial stage of development in computer communication networks from several aspects. One of them is the ingenious application of queueing theory to the performance evaluation of communication networks. Queueing theory is still useful in contemporary service systems having human customers and servers as precious resources. However, some new theoretical development is needed to cope with human service systems. In this article, the potential of queueing theory is discussed in the scope of emerging service science. We begin with a snapshot of Professor Kleinrock's laboratory in the early 1980s. We then review the performance metric called power worked out by Kleinrock as it determines the optimal input rate in a service system. As an example of service science for healthcare, we show modeling of obstetric patient flow in a hospital by means of Little's law and a network of M/M/m and M/G/infinity queues.

AB This study proposes a new typological framework for classifying smart city services. Intentionally focused on citizen-centricity, away from bureaucratic perspectives that most typologies have taken, this typology is derived from marketing and service science literature. The proposed typology consists of four dimensions: mode of technology (automate-informative-transformative), purpose of service (hedonic-utilitarian), service authority (voluntary-mandatory), and delivery mode (passive-interactive). This typological framework is validated with a qualitative exercise of classifying inventories of actual smart city services in practice into the framework Exercise results revealed that the categories provided are mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive in general, and useful in further conceptualization of new services by identifying gaps in reality. In practice, this typology would be useful in positioning specific smart city service under development in terms of citizen-centricity. Urban planners and administrators may use this framework in understanding the pattern of their service development. Also, this framework may provide a useful guideline for service designer pinpointing the design characteristics of old and new smart city services from the perspective of users and customers of city services: citizens.

AB The gap between science and practice has been highlighted in a number of scientific disciplines, including the newly developing domain of ecosystem service science, posing a challenge for the sustainable management of ecosystem services for human wellbeing. While methods to explore science-practice gaps are developing, testing and revisions of these methods are still needed so as to identify opportunities for mainstreaming ecosystem service science into development policies and practice. We designed and tested an approach to explore the presence and nature of a research-management gap in order to identify ways to close the gap, using a South African case study. Our combining of traditional review processes with stakeholder interviews highlighted that ecosystem services are not explicitly referred to by the majority of ecosystem management-related documents, processes or individuals. Nevertheless, at the local level, our approach unearthed strategic opportunities for bridging the gap in the tourism, disaster management and conservation sectors. We also highlighted the current trend towards transdisciplinary learning networks seen in the region. While we found a gap between the research and management of ecosystem services, a rigorous study thereof, which transcends its mere identification, proved useful in identifying key opportunities and challenges for bridging the gap.

AB Recent service perspectives (represented by service-dominant logic, service logic and service science; henceforth, service-logics) provide a mindset for understanding value co-creation as a mutual service process in which firms and customers integrate their resources. The idea that customer and firm resources should be jointly considered to properly explain perceived value is appealing, particularly in interactional settings such as e-commerce. However, we conduct a literature review and show that cross-sectional empirical e-commerce research intended to explain customer value perceptions continues to rely heavily on a unilateral approach (firm resources), which could be misleading. Subsequently, we identify possible barriers for considering service-logics in e-commerce research, which include the lack of a clear definition and classification of resources and an integrated set of valid and reliable measures of resources. We then take a step forward towards overcoming these barriers by providing a summary, a synthesis and new ideas or, at least, a new emphasis on the implications of existing ideas. The new idea/emphasis is that cross-sectional empirical e-commerce research should jointly consider customer resources and firm resources. No prior work has stressed this proposition. We provide a synthesis by re-organizing scarce and scattered service-logics-oriented existing literature on resources to offer a definition and a comprehensive framework for the classification of resources. Finally, we provide a summary by putting together valid and reliable measures of firm resources and customer resources that have been sparsely considered in the 69 studies selected. These measures could be used by researchers in order to model and test value co-creation processes in e-commerce B2C contexts.

AB Aspects of chemistry content knowledge held by 265 UK-based pre-service teachers (PSTs) were probed using 28 diagnostic questions in five chemistry concept areas, Particle theory and changes of state, Mass conservation (taught to 11-14-year-olds), and Chemical bonding, Mole calculations and Combustion reactions (taught to 14-16-year-olds). Data were collected over six years from academically able science graduates starting a full-time, university-based teacher education programme of one academic year duration. PSTs in three sub-cohorts ('chemists', 'physicists' and 'biologists' on the basis of their undergraduate degrees) demonstrated similar levels of content knowledge (CK) for Particle theory and changes of state and Mass conservation. Biologists demonstrated statistically significantly weaker understanding than chemists and physicists in Chemical bonding, Mole calculations and Combustion reactions. Forty-four 'triads' each comprising one chemist, physicist and biologist, matched by academic and personal backgrounds, showed that chemists outperformed biologists and physicists in Chemical bonding and Combustion reactions. The findings suggest that non-chemists' CK is insufficient for teaching these chemistry concepts in high schools, despite their possession of 'good' Bachelor of Science degrees. These data have implications for science teacher education, including how best to prepare science graduates from diverse backgrounds for teaching specialist science subjects to 11-16-year-olds.

AB This paper examines the antecedents and consequences of perceived value in m-government continuance use. Drawing upon service science studies and Chinese m-government context, a research model is constructed by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM). Data collected from a field survey of 326 m-government users are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that perceived value is strongly influenced by mobility, perceived usefulness and security, which is, in turn, significant impact on satisfaction and trust in technology, trust in agent and trust in government. These results contribute to drawing attention to the important role of perceived value in m-government continuance use and providing a new view that supplements to the extant technology acceptance research.

AB STIMULATE (Science Training Immersive Modules for University Learning Around Teacher Education) is a Serious Educational Game (SEG) designed to advance science teacher preparation and development, by creating a laboratory safety module that immerse teachers in scenarios previously taught using only hypothetical case studies. This study employed a two-phase design based methodology. The first phase was a cognitive task analysis of a convenience sample (n = 10) of preservice and in-service science teachers in which they described their key issues and concerns regarding chemical laboratory safety planning, response, management plan, and assessment. Phase 2 examined the usability and effectiveness of STIMULATE's initial build on 31 preservice teachers. The t-test for equality of means demonstrates that there is a statistically significant difference between pretest and post-test scores, t(30) = 14.79, p<.001, d = 2.56 (large) Overall, results suggest positive learning gains from the preservice science teachers who engaged in STIMULATE program.

AB The purpose of this paper is to report on the challenges we faced in designing an instrument aimed at measuring pre-service science teachers' topic-specific pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). After the instrument was conceptualised and developed, it was administered to 30 pre-service chemistry teachers. The findings suggest that the instrument can be used as a teaching tool to enhance pre-service science teachers' topic-specific PCK along with some limitations. The discussion focuses on the implications of the aforementioned PCK assessment tool for enhancing pre-service science teachers' topic-specific PCK and the challenges associated with measuring and enhancing pre-service science teachers' PCK. Finally, our discussion focuses on the ways in which science-teacher educators can engage in transforming the concept of PCK and its use for research and professional development.

AB In this study, the effects of inquiry-based learning practices on the scientific process skills, creative thinking, and attitudes towards science experiments of preservice science teachers have been analyzed. A non-experimental quantitative analysis method, the single-group pre test posttest design, has been used. In order to observe the scientific skill level development of pre-service teachers, the Scientific Process Skills Test and experiment worksheets have been used. Furthermore, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking has been used for determining the development of creative thinking levels and to specify the development of attitudes towards science experiments, the Attitude Scale towards Understanding the Purpose of Science Experiments has been used. At the end of the study, it was determined that inquiry-based laboratory practices improved the scientific process skills and all creative thinking levels and attitudes towards science experiments of pre-service science teachers.

AB The present research is a survey study carried out on pre-service teachers in the Education Faculty at Celal Bayar University (n=174). The study employed a questionnaire consisting of close-ended and semi-open-ended questions administered to determine the opinions of pre-service teachers about the alternative assessment-evaluation approaches they prefer. Furthermore, the self-efficacy scale was used to determine the efficacy of pre-service teachers towards alternative assessment-evaluation approaches. As shown by the results of the analysis, the pre-service teachers stated that they would like to use frequently instruments such as portfolios, performance assessment, concept maps, observation, and concept cartoons in their future teaching careers. Moreover, the MANOVA results revealed a significant difference in the self-efficacy of pre-service teachers about alternative assessment-evaluation approaches according to gender, while it did not significantly differ with the variables of department and grade. On the basis of the obtained results, certain suggestions are made with regard to the use of alternative assessment-evaluation approaches.

AB This article presents a novel collaborative service system (CSS) design methodology supporting the work of multiple participating users and collaborative services processes. The CSS application of music content creation paradigm called DesignStorming as it pertains to CSS modeling and developing. CSS is an interactive service system that can be systematic service innovation and automatic semi-automated value co-creation between service providers and customers to enhance service productivity. The objectives of this research are threefolda"Euroto propose a novel design methodology for CSS, to incorporate simple service machine (SSM) and intelligent service machine (ISM) for CSS, and to demonstrate a CSS application of music content creation. SSM is a road map that can be used to define the salient attribute elements for CSS design. According to the predefined SSM, ISM conducts modeling the cognitive process of service exchanges and service provision, their knowledge representations, and value co-production process for a computerized CSS. DesignStorming demonstrates how a CSS can be automated the interactive communications and problem solving processes during the music content creation work. The CSS application involves the three system components: 1) Ontology Developer, 2) SFGA Partnership Matcher, and 3) Co-created Value Appraiser. In addition, a service evaluation model is described and evaluated, so that some of their important characteristics can be identified. Such a comprehensive design methodology can provide the foundation for building future more diversified and innovative collaborative service system.

AB Service systems engineering (SSE) focuses on the systematic design and development of service systems. Guided by a value proposition, service systems enable value co-creation through a configuration of actors and resources (often including a service architecture, technology, information, and physical artifacts), therefore constituting complex socio-technical systems. IS research can play a leading role in understanding and developing service systems. SSE calls for research leading to actionable design theories, methods and approaches for systematically designing, developing and piloting service systems, based upon understanding the underlying principles of service systems. Three major challenges have been identified: engineering service architectures, engineering service systems interactions, and engineering resource mobilization, i.e. extending the access to and use of resources by means of IT. Researching SSE is challenging. Assessing the models, methods, or artifacts of SSE often requires embedded research within existing or even novel service systems. Consequently, approaches such as piloting IT-based innovations, design research or action research are the most promising for SSE research. As an integrative discipline, IS is in a unique position to spearhead the efforts in advancing the architecture, interaction, and resource base of service systems with evidence-based design.

AB Service operations, such as call centers and various business processes, are often outsourced by e-commerce companies and others to offshore locations for many operational reasons, including cost savings. The trade-off these companies face is lack of control over the service quality, which has affected customer satisfaction in many cases. When a customer's call is routed to a third-party call center rather than handled by the firm itself, the perception of quality loss could be a source of customer dissatisfaction. The problem intensifies when multiple call centers are involved. In our analytical model, the firm uses a contract for the allocation of quantity to motivate the two suppliers to improve their quality. Our results show that such a contract can induce an improvement in service quality in the market. In this way, the outsourcing firm's customers who use the call centers are assured of a higher level of consistent quality even if their calls are routed to one of the third-party call centers. We present analytical results on the optimal policies of both the buyer and the suppliers in a two-supplier market. We also study a more realistic asymmetric information case in which the buyer does not know the value of the suppliers' cost parameter and the buyer has to design a contract under information asymmetry. We also present numerical results. The paper contributes to theory by providing a game-theoretic model for a two-supplier outsourcing case with and without information asymmetry in which a new volume allocation strategy is proposed. The results provide practical guidelines to an outsourcing firm for ways to manipulate market variables to influence the suppliers and obtain higher service quality and profit levels.

AB The air cargo transportation system is a large and complex service system, in which demand forecasting is a key element in the master planning process. Demand forecasting is essential for analyzing existing cargo flight schedules and identifying future facility requirements of air cargo companies. We use the Potluck Problem approach to propose a multiproducer/multiconsumer solution for predicting the cargo demand of a specific airline in a given route, and the cargo load factor for a given flight schedule on that route. This solution considers each airline as a producer and the users of air cargo services as consumers, with a producer having no explicit communication with other producers/airlines. The model analyzes the existing cargo capacity plan, highlights drawbacks, and proposes a new capacity plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the solution. Examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the approach.

AB In this paper, we consider a natural ranking problem that arises in settings in which a community of people (or agents) are engaged in regular interactions with an end goal of creating value. Examples of such scenarios are academic collaboration networks, creative collaborations, and interactions between agents of a service delivery organization. For instance, consider a service delivery organization which essentially resolves a sequence of service requests from its customers by deploying its agents to resolve the requests. Typically, resolving a request requires interaction between multiple agents and results in an outcome (or value). The outcome could be success or failure of problem resolution or an index of customer satisfaction. For this scenario, the ranking of the agents of the network should take into account two aspects: importance of the agents in the network structure that arises as a result of interactions and the value generated by the interactions involving the respective agents. Such a ranking can be used for several purposes such as identifying influential agents of the interaction network, effective and efficient spreading of messages in the network. In this paper, we formally model the above ranking problem and develop a novel algorithm for computing the ranking. The key aspect of our approach is creating special nodes in the interaction network corresponding to the outcomes and endowing them independent, external status. The algorithm then iteratively spreads the external status of the outcomes to the agents based on their interactions and the outcome of those interactions. This results in an eigenvector like formulation, which results in a method requiring computing the inverse of a matrix rather than the eigenvector. We present several theoretical characterizations of our algorithmic approach. We present experimental results on the public domain real-life datasets from the Internet Movie Database and a dataset constructed by retrieving impact and citation ratings for papers listed in the DBLP database.

AB The transition to a service economy through the transformation of social structures has become a global phenomenon that affects research and development (R&D) organizations. However, the innovation and R&D management literatures are mainly rooted in product development based on technological trajectories, which is not necessarily applicable to services. To fill this gap, the field of service marketing has introduced the service-dominant logic perspective, which does not separate services from goods. This paper proposes a new R&D model focusing on value cocreation through the study of a technology-based R&D unit in the information technology company. A set of hypotheses was developed and tested using data from R&D activities related to service innovation projects. The findings suggest that the technology developed through R&D contributes to value cocreation interactions between the R&D organization and the customer, which are facilitated by mutual organizational understanding. They also contribute to the discovery of research themes. The result is the emergence of a new type of service-oriented researcher who focuses not only on creating new technologies and adapting them to the customer site but also on discovering research themes by broadening the scope of research to the creation of new service systems. The managerial implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.

AB This study empirically explores a real-world manufacturer product development process from a service science perspective. In this era of keen global competition, the process of product development is crucial for companies before the final product is launched to the market. The poor development of a product can fail to meet customer needs and result in product failure, which can even lead to significant losses for manufacturers. However, traditional product development processes are much more manufacture-oriented rather than customer-involved. In this paper, we aim to use the Service science, management, and engineering (SSME) perspective, proposed by IBM, to improve product demand asymmetries by discovering true user requirements in order to enhance customer involvement and lead to better product development. We show how SSME is applied in the context of product development and in the discovery of customer needs, and propose a modified process based on SSME to the product development process.

AB Maintaining long-term customer loyalty has been an important issue in the service industry. Although customer satisfaction can be enhanced with better service quality, delivering appropriate services to customers poses challenges to service providers, particularly in real-time and resource-limited dynamic service contexts. However, customer expectation management has been regarded as an effective way for helping service providers achieve high customer satisfaction in the real world that is nevertheless less real-time and dynamic. This study designs a FCM-based customer expectation-driven service dispatch system to empower providers with the capability to deal effectively with the problem of delivering right services to right customers in right contexts. Our evaluation results show that service providers can make appropriate decisions on service dispatch for customers by effectively managing customer expectations and arranging their contextual limited resources and time via the proposed service dispatch system. Meanwhile, customers can receive suitable service and obtain high satisfaction when appropriate services are provided. Accordingly, a high-performance ecosystem can be established by both service providers and customers who co-create value in the dynamic service contexts.

AB Background: Argumentation is accepted by many science educators as a major component of science education. Many studies have investigated students' conceptual understanding and their engagement in argumentative activities. However, studies conducted in the subject of chemistry are very rare.
   Purpose: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of argumentation-based chemistry lessons on pre-service science teachers' understanding of reaction rate concepts, their quality of argumentation, and their consideration of specific reaction rate concepts in constructing an argument. Moreover, students' perceptions of argumentation lessons were explored.
   Sample: There were 116 participants (21 male and 95 female), who were pre-service first-grade science teachers from a public university. The participants were recruited from the two intact classes of a General Chemistry II course, both of which were taught by the same instructor.
   Design and methods: In the present study, non-equivalent control group design was used as a part of quasi-experimental design. The experimental group was taught using explicit argumentation activities, and the control group was instructed using traditional instruction. The data were collected using a reaction rate concept test, a pre-service teachers' survey, and the participants' perceptions of the argumentation lessons questionnaire. For the data analysis, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, the Mann-Whitney U-test and qualitative techniques were used.
   Results: The results of the study indicated that an argumentation-based intervention caused significantly better acquisition of scientific reaction rate-related concepts and positively impacted the structure and complexity of pre-service teachers' argumentation. Moreover, the majority of the participants reported positive feelings toward argumentation activities.
   Conclusions: As students are encouraged to state and support their view in the chemistry classroom when studying reaction rate, it was observed that their understanding increased in terms of both the context and the quality of the argumentation that they produced. In light of the findings, it is suggested that argumentation activities should be developed to promote students' science content knowledge and argumentation skills.

AB This article explores pre-service and in-service science teachers' perceptions on active learning, and examines the effectiveness of active learning by pre-service science teachers in the Irish second level classroom through a two-phase study. In the first phase, data on perceptions were gathered from final year pre-service teachers and in-service teachers in Irish post-primary schools. In the second phase, pre-service science teachers, working with teacher educators, designed a comparative test for students in lower secondary science classrooms. This tested achievement differences for students taught in traditional ways and students taught using active learning approaches. While the test results show a significant difference between traditional teaching and active learning, overall analysis indicates that the majority of teachers in the study were not convinced of the value of this way of teaching. The findings have implications for science teaching and the enactment of curriculum reform measures in compulsory education.

AB The purpose of this study is to identify the foci and results of studies on socioscientific issues (SSI) conducted in Turkey. Additionally, the study aimed to compare the results of this study with ones conducted internationally. For this aim, a literary review of empirical studies related to SSI conducted in Turkey was carried out. Four criteria were used to identify the research studies included in this review: studies which are contemporary (2002- 2012), were conducted in Turkey (sampling Turkish populations), which focus on SSI in science education, and which used first-hand data gathered through empirical investigations. Related databases were searched using "SSI and Turkey" and "SSI and Turkish" keywords in both English and Turkish. The search resulted in 13 empirical research articles and 17 Master's and Doctoral theses. After the initial review of the studies based on the established criteria, 11 articles and 13 theses were identified for inclusion in this review. The results showed that SSI related studies conducted in Turkey, similar to international studies, have two roles. While the aim was to teach SSI in some studies, in other studies, SSI were used as a context to reach other broader, science education related aims. Studies mostly focused on the knowledge of pre-service science teachers regarding various SSI, the self-efficacy beliefs of teaching and the informal reasoning skills in the context of SSI. The majority of the studies were master's theses. Another important point that needs to be paid attention to is that SSI related studies in Turkey tended to employ quantitative methods while very few studies utilized in-depth qualitative methods.

AB This study presents pre-service science teachers' views about implementing a case study and which skills they improved as a result of using the method. Sixteen participants in a chemistry class were the subjects in the 2013 summer school term. In the teaching about the properties of chromium, students watched selected parts of the movie Erin Brockovich in four sections. Each part of the movie was followed with a question, and students were then given about 15-20 minutes to find out the answer to the question by using Internet-based resources in the classroom environment. Qualitative data were collected by having participants respond in writing to open-ended questions and through semi-structured interviews. Overall, students' reactions to the method were positive. The results showed that students found it to be an effective instructional method, despite having some difficulties with the expectations of the method and this method has provided many benefits for pre-service teachers.

AB This study was carried out on 97 participants using a mixed research design, in order to determine the effect of microteaching on the teaching skills of pre-service science teachers and to ascertain the opinions of pre-service teachers about the positive and negative effects of microteaching. Analysis of the data revealed that microteaching has a significant effect on teaching skills, and this effect can be seen under the areas of carrying out an introduction lesson, classroom management, time management and planning, effective communication and concluding the lesson, as well as issues which can be described as being related to self-confidence. In the qualitative section of the study, analysis of the data obtained from written responses and individual interviews with pre-service teachers about the positive and the negative effects of microteaching support the quantitative findings.

AB This study compared male and female pre-service science teachers' understanding of the effect of phase changes and physical transformation of matter on the size of particles, spaces between particles, speed of particles, and number of particles. Data were collected using a questionnaire that has 36 items. Both gender groups had sound understanding of the effect of phase change on speed, spaces, and number of particles in a substance, and the effect of compression on speed, number, size and spaces between particles in solids and liquids. However, most female pre-service teachers had low understanding of the effect of phase change on the size of the particles in solids, liquids and gases as most of them incorrectly believed that heating increases the size of the particles and cooling decreases the size of particles. The results have implications for science teaching and learning and teacher education.

AB This study was conducted to examine the relationships among pre-service science teachers' (PSTs') teaching and learning conceptions, scientific epistemological beliefs and science teaching efficacy beliefs. 310 Turkish PSTs from different regions of the country participated in the study. Three different instruments were validated by confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that participants' constructivist conceptions of teaching and learning promoted sophisticated science related epistemologies. Sophisticated epistemologies, to some extent, also contributed participants' science teaching efficacy beliefs. Certain assumptions were not supported by the results which pointed out that curricular reform in teacher education system met expectations partly. Implications were presented considering the results.

AB The proliferation of e-business has intensified competition for online customer satisfaction. Previous research has primarily offered a single view of customer satisfaction from marketing or technical perspective. Although each view has helped improve our understanding of online customer satisfaction, a framework to integrate these viewpoints is missing from the current literature. The service science theory examines customer satisfaction with online services from multiple perspectives. An integrative view of customer satisfaction with e-service is possible with the interdisciplinary lens of service science theory. This study conducted a survey with 377 customers of four online stores. Marketing and technical constructs consisting of twelve key variables were incorporated into a regression analysis to understand the effect of each variable on the dependent variable of customer satisfaction. The analysis results show that although these constructs do have a significant influence on customer satisfaction, not all the variables of each construct have the same effect. Thus it is important to take an integrative approach in examining online customer satisfaction. The findings of this research offer such a view of increasing online customer satisfaction by improving key marketing and technical factors.

AB Purpose - Understanding the role and implications of information and communication technology (ICT) in service is the key research priority for service science and the management of service quality. The purpose of this paper is to address this priority by providing insights into the role of "engagement platforms" (EPs), physical or virtual customer touch points where actors exchange resources and co-create value. Despite an emerging body of literature that emphasizes the fit between engagement and technology-enabled service contexts, EPs remain ill-defined. Specifically, little is known about the particular types of EPs, their characteristics, and implications for the performance of service ecosystems and managing service quality.
   Design/methodology/approach - By drawing on two illustrative case studies, the authors investigate and theorize about the characteristics and dynamics of EPs in virtual/physical contexts, and identify if, how and to what extent configurations of EPs may enhance resource exchange within and across service ecosystems.
   Findings - By building on emerging research at the service/engagement interface, the paper introduces the notion of the "engagement ecosystem," as a configuration of individual, mutually dependent EPs that represent specific interactivity-facilitative loci. The paper explicates the relevance of the model and highlight opportunities for future research in this emerging field of inquiry.
   Research limitations/implications - The work addresses the call for research at the intersection of ICT and service science through development and application of the engagement ecosystem concept. The theorizing process draws on two illustrative case studies, and thereby provides a theoretical contribution and foundation for future research in this emerging area.
   Practical implications - The authors guide managerial decision-making regarding the implementation, adoption, and utilization of engagement ecosystems. Furthermore, the nature of "engagement" as a bridging concept implies that the work can help managers to operationalize service-centric thinking.
   Originality/value - By showing how individual EPs form engagement ecosystems, the paper bridges theory and practice, and offers new insight in the realm of practical application of the S-D logic.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to summarize and classify extant research and to better understand the past, present, and future state of the theory of value co-creation. Its main objectives are: to identify the different theoretical perspectives and research streams that characterize and define the co-creation literature, and to highlight the connections between them; to look for emerging trends and gaps in the literature by comparing the most recent papers with those representing the field's core.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper relies on bibliometric data: co-citation techniques were employed to select, analyze, and interpret citation patterns within the co-creation literature.
   Findings - The paper identified two main clusters, as well as specific research streams and common themes, representing scholarly journals' publications on co-creation over the past years. These research streams and themes apply three different theoretical perspectives: service science, innovation and technology management, and marketing and consumer research. Data from the most recent publications has been used to verify if and how the original streams and themes are reflected in the contemporary debate.
   Research limitations/implications - Inevitably, the findings of the analysis have limitations related to the research design, the databases, and the applied bibliometric methods.
   Practical implications - From a practical perspective, the research impacts on theory building, management decision making, and teaching.
   Originality/value - This study depicts the remarkable development of the literature on co-creation and shows the latent structure underlying its different research streams. To the best knowledge, this study is the first to determine co-citation frequencies from both the SSCI and Scopus databases.

AB The main purpose of science education is to enable students to connect concepts with daily life and establish relations between the concepts. Thus, many implementations related to constructivism have been carried out. The aim of the study is to explore how students' conceptual perceptions related to "Force and Motion" subject changed with meaningful learning. Pre-test-post test single group design, one of the experimental research designs, were used in the research. In order to interpret the students' results in meaningful learning process, Conceptual Perception Test related to Force and Motion subject (CPTFM) was developed and the test was composed of five open-ended questions. The content of the items in the test was developed in such a way to include "Action-Reaction Law", "Gravity", and "Pairs of Balanced Forces." The points obtained from the evaluation instrument were evaluated according to the levels created by the researcher. 35 students in their third year of study in the Department of Science Teaching participated in the study. The results of the study revealed that meaningful learning activities made positive contributions to pre-service teachers' conceptual perceptions related to force and motion concepts.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate pre-service science teachers' understanding levels of Kepler's second and third laws. The participants of the study were 38 pre-service science teachers who attended introductory astronomy class in their teacher education program. The participants' understandings of Kepler's laws were examined by their answers to ranking tasks, which required participants to rank the situations given in the question, and then to explain the reasons behind their answers. The findings showed that the participants' understanding levels ranged from partial understanding with alternative conceptions to sound understanding. Moreover the number of the participants with partial understanding with alternative conceptions exceeded the participants with sound understanding. The participants' explanations to ranking tasks also indicated that although participants knew the classic statements of Kepler's laws, they had also alternative conceptions. Five different alternative conceptions were identified from the participants' explanations. Two of them have not been reported in previous studies.

AB This article presents a qualitative study exploring service employees' experiences of quality-productivity tensions in the workplace, and how they cope with such conflicts. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 service employees. Content analysis suggests that organization-level conflict derives from the different channels that service organizations use to convey the importance of quality (e. g. training) and of productivity (e. g. rewards) to employees. During service interactions, employees experience conflict when standardization is violated and productivity is threatened. Our results demonstrate and explain employees' strategies for coping with the conflict between productivity and quality and with the 'double message' they receive about these two goals. Many of these strategies are intended to ensure quality while maintaining productivity. We discuss the study's contribution to service science, and explain existing organizational mechanisms and processes for communicating the importance of quality and productivity to employees. Implications for service management are discussed.

AB A critical aspect of teacher education is gaining pedagogical content knowledge of how to teach science for conceptual understanding. Given the time limitations of college methods courses, it is difficult to touch on more than a fraction of the science topics potentially taught across grades K-8, particularly in the context of relevant pedagogies. This research and development work centers on constructing a formative assessment resource to help expose pre-service teachers to a greater number of science topics within teaching episodes using various modes of instruction. To this end, 100 problem-based, science pedagogy assessment items were developed via expert group discussions and pilot testing. Each item contains a classroom vignette followed by response choices carefully crafted to include four basic pedagogies (didactic direct, active direct, guided inquiry, and open inquiry). The brief but numerous items allow a substantial increase in the number of science topics that pre-service students may consider. The intention is that students and teachers will be able to share and discuss particular responses to individual items, or else record their responses to collections of items and thereby create a snapshot profile of their teaching orientations. Subsets of items were piloted with students in pre-service science methods courses, and the quantitative results of student responses were spread sufficiently to suggest that the items can be effective for their intended purpose.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate how the in-service science teachers' (IST) perceptions and practices about curriculum and integration of the history of science (HOS) and the nature of science (NOS) affect their science courses. For this aim, how ISTs integrated the NOS and HOS in their elementary science courses for understanding of the NOS, the results of this integration, and how the ISTs' NOS views influenced their science teaching practices were examined. In this phenomenological study purpose and criterion sampling methods were used. Nine ISTs constituted the sample of the study. A constant comparative method was utilized for the data analysis. Multiple data sources and different evaluators were used for triangulation. The current study revealed that all the teachers in the study do their best to implement the science and technological curriculum; however, the implementation of the curriculum is not at the expected level. Also our findings indicated that the teachers' views about NOS did not directly influence their educational practices. In addition, knowing how to teach NOS is an important factor for a teacher's transfer of their knowledge and understanding of NOS to their classroom, as well as the teacher's NOS views. In this process some possible problems such as creating misconceptions, not explaining the NOS aspects effectively, differences in the students' beliefs, individual differences, and problems in the classroom environment might emerge and negatively affect the teachers' integration of NOS and HOS.

TI Fostering geospatial thinking in science education through a
   customisable smartphone application
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Enhanced capabilities of modern smartphones offer the potential to design tools that support new forms of teaching and learning. Increased access to mobile-networked environments and geospatial systems provide opportunities for developing new educational experiences that support a geospatial approach to science, fostering new ways of thinking about science. However, designing effective innovative educational mobile applications remains a challenge. Applications need to be accessible to teachers that are not tech-savvy as well as those that are, foster active learning pedagogies, enable flexible and creative use, as well as fit within the curriculum. This paper describes a smartphone application developed together with pre-service science teachers, designed to be customisable by teachers while supporting a geospatial approach to science education. The design process and trial illustrate application use, how it supports a geospatial approach to science education and raises issues around mobile technologies, teacher pedagogies and adoption.

AB The present research aims to determine whether or not pre-service science teachers in Turkey are resistant to learning about the theory of evolution (TOE), and to understand the reasons for their acceptance or rejection of this theory. Following an intervention process, essay documents were collected from each participant (N=113) and analysed using typological techniques. Then, the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) survey was employed (N=93). Finally, an interview was conducted (N=6) and the data were analysed in the frame work of inductive analysis techniques. According to the essay document analysis, almost all participants had neither conceptual knowledge of the TOE nor any scientific argumentation ability in the context of Toulmin's Argument Pattern (TAP). Participants who did not believe in the TOE mostly used Islamic rhetoric as a basis for their arguments rather than a scientific point of view. The MATE survey results indicated that participants' own ideological perspective was the only determinant factor which was statistically significant (p<.01). Finally, the responses to the interview questions revealed that participants tended to rely on rote-learning rather than inquiry-based science education and that attitudes to TOE were influenced by inter-related social, political and religous pressures.

AB Drawing from the phenomenographic perspective, an exploratory study investigated Chinese teacher educators' conceptions of teaching Nature of Science (NOS) to pre-service science teachers through semi-structured interviews. Five key dimensions emerged from the data. This paper focuses on the dimension, NOS content to be taught to pre-service science teachers. A total of 20 NOS elements were considered by the Chinese science teacher educators to be important ideas to be taught. It was also found that among these educators, whether focusing on the classical or contemporary NOS elements in NOS instruction was a prominent controversy. After explaining the criteria for differentiating between classical and contemporary NOS elements, this paper reports the specific NOS elements suggested by Chinese science teacher educators in this study. Afterward, it describes how all educators in this study were categorized in term of NOS content taught by them to pre-service science teachers. In the end, it discusses three factors influencing the decision on NOS content to be taught, i.e., view of the concept of NOS itself, vision of teaching NOS, and belief in general philosophy.

AB Limited world fossil fuel reserves and the expectation that these reserves will soon be depleted, place increased importance on renewable energy resources. Therefore, it is highly critical to educate pre-service teachers, who will be bringing up future generations of school children, about renewable energy and resources. To that end, a 39 point questionnaire developed by Morgil et al. [1] have been applied to a total of 240 pre-service teachers (60 pre-service teachers each in first, second, third and fourth years) majoring in Elementary Science Teaching at a university in the Black Sea Region of Turkey, and their awareness of renewable energy topics were determined. The study has concluded that while no gender-based meaningful differences exist with respect to the awareness of pre-service teachers for renewable energy [t((238)) = 0.789, p > .05], there are differences based on year-of-study [F-(3,F-236) = 16.376, p < .051. An analysis based on pre-service teachers' years of study has resulted in statistically meaningful (p < .05) differences being found, with respect to awareness for renewable energy, upon comparing third year students with first (p = .000), second (p = .000) and fourth (p = .015) year students, and upon comparing fourth year students with first year students (p = .002).

AB Problem Statement: The constructivist reorganization of the elementary education programs in Turkey has revealed the importance of training skilled teachers who are familiar with both constructivist theory and the educational programs. In this way, teachers can adapt to their new roles, learn how to guide students, and prepare the best learning environment. Therefore, the determination of the pre-service science and technology teachers' mental images of science teaching is assumed to provide great insight for the teacher training institutions into pre-service teachers' perceptions of the teaching profession and of their students.
   Purpose of Study: The purpose of this study is to determine the mental images of science teaching of the students of the Department of Science and Technology Education of Education Faculty at the University of Mersin and present the differences in their mental images in terms of certain variables.
   Methods: This study is based on descriptive methods, and the universe consists of students of the Department of Science and Technology Education of Education Faculty at the University of Mersin in 2009-2010. 113 students were randomly selected for this study. The Draw-A-Science-Teacher-Test Checklist (DASTT-C) is one of the tools that can be used to measure pre-service teachers' perceptions of teaching science. Variables such as gender and the year of study were covered in the sub-problems of the research. T-test and one way analysis of variance were carried out by using SPSS-15.
   Findings and Results: As a result of this study, it was found that 13.08% of the pre-service teachers of science and technology courses had student-centered images (exploratory teaching style), 62.62% had mental images positioned between student-centered science teaching and traditional science teaching (conceptual teaching style), and 24.30% had traditional science teaching images (explicit teaching style).
   Conclusions and Recommendations: In practical courses, such as school experience and teaching practice, pre-service teachers can be provided with opportunities to conduct observations and teach. Academic staff can act as a model by including student-centered activities in their courses.

AB The study presents an organisational analysis into the linked issues of service productivity and perceived service quality. The operations management literature postulates that a trade-off exists between service productivity and perceived service quality, an assertion which is supported by evidence from managerial experiences and other academic researches. However, is it possible to prevail over the trade-off between productivity and perceived quality? Further, what is the effect of the trade-off on company profitability? To respond to these questions, a retrospective longitudinal study is performed, based on analysis of data collected from 52 offices of a major European banking group over the years 2010-2011. A first analysis verifies the existence of the trade-off. A second then examines the suitability of the employee incentive system intended to overcome the trade-off. Finally, a multiple linear regression model is developed in order to verify whether service productivity and perceived service quality impact on company profitability, and to what extent.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the kinds of argumentation schemes generated by pre-service elementary science teachers (PSTs) as they perform inquiry-oriented laboratory tasks, and to explore how argumentation schemes vary by task as well as by experimentation and discussion sessions. The model of argumentative and scientific inquiry was used as a design framework in the present study. According to the model, the inquiry of scientific topics was employed by groups of participants through experimentation and critical discussion sessions. The participants of the study were 35 PSTs, who teach middle school science to sixth through eighth grade students after graduation. The data were collected through video- and audio-recordings of the discussions made by PSTs in six inquiry-oriented laboratory sessions. For the analysis of data, pre-determined argumentation schemes by Walton were employed. The results illustrated that PSTs applied varied premises rather than only observations or reliable sources to ground their claims or to argue for a case or an action. It is also worthy of notice that the construction and evaluation of scientific knowledge claims resulted in different numbers and kinds of arguments. Results of this study suggest that designing inquiry-oriented laboratory environments, which are enriched with critical discussion, provides discourse opportunities that can support argumentation. Moreover, PSTs can be encouraged to support and promote argumentation in their future science classrooms if they engage in argumentation integrated instructional strategies.

AB This article considers the impact of scaffolding on pre-service science teachers' constitution of identities as teachers of inquiry. This scaffolding has consisted of 2 major components, a unit on current electricity which encompasses the inquiry continuum and an open inquiry which is situated in context of classroom practice. Our analysis indicates 2 major themes. The first is the importance of scaffolding inquiry as a strategy for engaging in the discourses, experiences, and emotions that are foundational to the constitution of identity from the post-structural perspective. The second theme is that the opportunity to conduct an open inquiry, while concurrently considering its pedagogical implications, provides our pre-service teachers with an appreciation of the value of inquiry.

AB Climate change is a complex environmental problem that can be used to examine students' understanding, gained through classroom communication, of climate change and its interactions. The present study examines a series of four science sessions given to a group of primary school student teachers (n = 20). This includes analysis of the communication styles used and the students' pre- and post-conceptualisation of climate change based on results obtained via essay writing and drawings. The essays and drawings concerned the students' unprompted pre- and post-conceptions about climate change, collected before and after each of the four inquiry-based science sessions (in physics, chemistry, biology and geography). Concept mapping was used in the analysis of the students' responses. The communication used in the four sessions was analysed with a communicative approach in order to find out the discussion about climate change between teacher and students. The analyses indicated that the students did not have the knowledge or the courage to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map showed that students' thinking had become more coherent after the four sessions. Given the results of the present study, proposals for using concepts maps and/or communication analysis in studying students' conceptions are presented.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term effectiveness of a three-dimensional (3D) computer modeling supported predict-observe-explain (POE) strategy on pre-service science teachers' understanding of lunar concepts. Thirty-three preservice teachers participated in the study. A questionnaire was used to assess participants' understanding of the phases of the Moon and eclipses before, after, and 22 months after the instruction. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six participants before and after the instruction. The results demonstrated that few participants had a scientific understanding about the targeted lunar concepts before the instruction. However, the majority of the participants had a scientific understanding after the instruction indicating that the instructional intervention was quite effective in facilitating conceptual change. The results also demonstrated that twenty-two months after the instruction most participants maintained their scientific conceptual understanding suggesting that the powerful learning environment designed for this study was effective in promoting a durable conceptual change.

AB Service science offers fresh perspective to reorient the debate on what is progress' and whether or not it is slowing down, and if so, what might be done to reframe progress at the speed limit of what is possible' with universities. When it comes to the rate of progress', universities can play a greater role in improving the deeply interconnected societal measures of innovativeness, competitive parity, sustainability and resiliency. During the current great recession', much is now being written about progress slowing down. From education levels to scientific discoveries to technical innovations to economic and environmental collapse, rhetoric about progress slowing down or nearing collapse or becoming uncompetitive in developed economies is on the rise. Boulding suggested in the skeleton of science' that over-specialization could create communication barriers between scientific specialists slowing down profitable talk. We propose that a service science reframing of progress with universities as essential institutional actors might positively reorient the debate. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI The Peripheral Knowledge Paradox: Interfirm Knowledge Partitioning and
   Integration in Services Contracting
SO SERVICE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article

   partitioning; knowledge integration; contracting
AB Specialized firms engaged in service offshoring contracts often face a tension between specializing in their own domain and maintaining knowledge in their partners' domains. When knowledge is "peripheral" to a firm's own specialty (e.g., an information technology (IT) service contractor's knowledge of a client's business domain or a client's technical knowledge of a contractor's domain), firms face a paradoxical dilemma of how much of such knowledge to invest in. This paper explores when it is important for clients and contractors to have in-house knowledge beyond their own, to be effective in IT service offshoring. We explore IT service engagements where it is more important for (a) the client to have deeper technical knowledge and (b) the contractor to have deeper business domain knowledge. We define the pattern of client-contractor knowledge overlaps as interfirm knowledge partitioning.
   The central thesis is that ex ante alignment between interfirm knowledge partitioning and service engagement newness enhances interfirm knowledge integration in offshoring engagements. To effectively organize service offshoring, solutions to interfirm knowledge integration problems in the presence of interfirm specialization are required; this is the underlying idea of this paper. The proposed model is tested using data on IT service offshoring engagements by 209 U.S. firms to foreign IT service firms. The findings offer novel theoretical insights into optimal interfirm knowledge partitioning in services contracting. Implications for service science theory and practice are also discussed.

AB Information technology (IT)-related service is the strategic management of the creation and delivery of service in which information and communication technology (referred to as IT here) plays a substantial role. IT can serve as a facilitator (e.g., facilitates access to customer information and customer communication) or enabler (e.g., enables value cocreation), serves as the context (e.g., mobile phone market or e-commerce), or is itself service (e.g., social networking sites or information goods). There are three essential characteristics of IT-related serviceit is information-intensive, customer-centric, and multidisciplinary. IT-related service is information-intensive. The ability to communicate (firm-to-customer, firm-to-firm, and customer-to-customer) anytime, anywhere, and to anyone, is significantly facilitated by the recent technology trends of big data, cloud computing, and mobile and networking platforms. IT-related service is customer-centric. The use of IT, both by firms and by customers, alleviates the common observation that there is a trade-off between customer satisfaction and productivity improvement for service. Customers are able to talk back to firms with their new communication power and firms are better able to cost-efficiently satisfy their customers. The study of IT-related service is thus inherently multidisciplinary involving such fields as marketing, strategic management, computer science/information systems, and operations management/organizational research. The results of the IT-service transformation are that IT blurs the distinction between goods and service; service is becoming more goods-like and goods are acquiring the characteristics of service. The Journal of Service Research special issue on IT-related service brings together all of these elements, and provides rich strategic implications for managers.

AB Using four basic principles of service science, we systematically explore value-proposition design as one type of business model innovation. Service science combines organization and human understanding with business and technological understanding to categorize and explain service systems, including how they interact and evolve to cocreate value. Our goal is to apply a scientific approach to advance design and innovation in service systems. Our foundation is service-dominant logic, which provides perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory. Our basic theoretical construct is the service system, entities that are dynamic configurations of four kinds of resources. Our core principles center on the way value is computed within and among entities, how interaction is based on access to resources and their capabilities, and on how value computation and interaction depend on symbol processing and language guided by mutually agreed-to value propositions. In this context, service science can inform and accelerate value-proposition design by systematizing the search for adaptive advantages that improve existing offerings, create new offerings, or reconfigure the value-creating ecosystem.

AB The concept of service innovation is significant for innovation strategy and economic growth. However, since the term "service innovation" represents a broad sense, there does not exist common understanding about what is service innovation even among experts. We developed a methodology to determine the structure and geographical distribution of knowledge, as well as to reveal the structure of research collaboration in such an interdisciplinary area as service innovation by performing journal information analysis, citation network analysis and visualization. Our results show that there are mainly two groups relating to service innovation. Knowledge in these areas has been growing rapidly in recent years. In particular, the fields of ecosystem and IT & Web are exhibiting high growth. We also demonstrated that the global network of knowledge is formed around the powerful hub of the US. The research competency of Asian countries lags behind that of the US and EU. With respect to research collaboration, we identify room for enhancing international collaboration. Our methodology could be useful in forming policies to promote service innovation. Finally, we propose the creation of an international collaboration fund. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Problem Statement: Based on developments in the 21st century technology has become a large part of the classroom experience. Teachers need to have an understanding of how technology can be coordinated with pedagogy and content knowledge in order to integrate technology effectively into classroom instruction. Self-efficacy beliefs toward technology also play a key role in technology integration. It has been shown that the beliefs of a teacher are closely linked to the technologies that they use and the way in which they use them. More specifically, the beliefs of a teacher with regards to their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) are pivotal in terms of using technology in the classroom because belief about their capability to use technology is a powerful predictor of their potential technology use. Hence, it is critical to measure pre-service teachers' self-efficacy beliefs toward TPACK in order to identify the factors that contribute to a teacher's use of technology in classroom instruction.
   Purpose of This Study: The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive instrument to determine pre-service science teacher's self-efficacy beliefs towards TPACK
   Methods: The participants in the study consisted of 808 senior pre-service science teachers in 17 colleges for teacher education. In this study, the data was split into two random subsamples to perform factor analysis. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted using one subsample (n = 420) to determine the factorial structure of the scale, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted on the second subsample (n = 388) in order to confirm the structure model obtained from the EFA analysis in cross-validation the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Self-Efficacy Scale (TPACK-SeS) for a different sample. Item total correlations and Cronbach's alpha internal reliability coefficient were utilized in determining the reliability of the whole scale and its subscales for both samples.
   Findings and Results: Based on the EFA results, the final version of the scale consists of an eight-factor structure with 52 items. Following EFA, CFA supported this eight-factor structure and showed a good fit with high indices. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, demonstrating the internal consistency reliability of the subscales and whole scale, were found to be high, and item total correlation coefficients were valid for the different samples.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: The results show that TPACK-SeS can serve as a valuable tool for teachers, educators, and researchers in evaluating pre-service science teacher's self-efficacy beliefs towards TPACK.

AB The application of information and communication technology in instruction is highly emphasized in the contemporary education of science teachers. This paper hence aims to explore science teachers' perceptions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) addressing teachers' perceptions of the affordances of technology application in instruction. A total of 222 pre- and in-service science teachers in Singapore were surveyed. Structural equation models analysis was utilized to examine the model of TPACK involving the seven factors of technological knowledge (TK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), content knowledge (CK), technological content knowledge (TCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), as well as synthesized knowledge of technology, pedagogy, and content (TPC). The results confirm the seven-factor model and indicate that the science teachers' perceived TPC significantly and positively correlated with all the other TPACK factors. This paper further reveals the relationships between the science teachers' perceptions of TPACK and their demographic characteristics such as teaching experience, gender, and age. The findings indicate that female science teachers perceive higher self-confidence in pedagogical knowledge but lower self-confidence in technological knowledge than males. Further, female in-service science teachers' perceptions of TK, TPK, TCK, and TPC significantly and negatively correlate with their age.

AB Electronic service quality (ESQ) is essential for explaining consumer value perceptions in B2C e-commerce contexts. However, we argue that focusing too narrowly on ESQ without considering consumer knowledge-related resources could lead managers to devise myopic strategies. Our research is inspired by, and intends to contribute to, service-dominant logic, service logic, and service science. These perspectives suggest that firms and consumers cocreate value by integrating their resources. However, the literature in these areas relies on conceptual development, and further empirical research is needed. The empirical study reported here is the first cross-sectional test that confers similar salience to both consumer resources, in the form of consumer expertise (and its antecedents), and firm resources, as represented by ESQ (and its antecedents), to explain value perception in a B2C e-commerce context. We provide evidence that both consumer expertise and ESQ directly and positively affect value perception, the magnitude of the effect of consumer expertise (ESQ) on value perception being smaller as ESQ (consumer expertise) increases, and vice versa. Our results offer interesting insights for designing successful e-commerce strategies. For instance, the negative interaction effect we found suggests that consumer expertise and ESQ behave as substitutes to some extent. Therefore, firms might reduce the expert/nonexpert value gap by incorporating in their websites tools addressed to palliate nonexperts' dis-advantages, or by upgrading these tools when available. Thus, recommender systems might be upgraded using information derived from experts' e-buying behavior and opinions, instead of considering only overall data from consumers with a similar taste profile.

ID CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS
AB Service experience design is a key issue in the service industry. Satisfactory service experiences provide customers with good memories and increase customer satisfaction, thus increasing customer loyalty and service provider profitability. However, providing customers with quality service experiences requires considering numerous factors, and thus is a complex and difficult issue both in academia and in real service contexts. Customer satisfaction results from the difference between customer perceptions and customer expectations. Hence, customer expectation management is important in delivering quality service experiences. Additionally, a competitive relationship exists among different service providers as well as between service providers and customers. The service experience delivery process can be regarded as a value co-creation process for service providers and customers who can implement either a competitive or cooperative strategy based on their goals and needs. This study accordingly presents an expectation based coopetition approach by using a real exhibition data of AutoTronics 2009 for simulations. The evaluation results show that this expectation-based coopetition approach can help service providers design and deliver quality service experiences and co-create value with customers, yielding a high performance ecosystem.

AB To gain a better understanding of teachers' beliefs about teaching, as compared with their in-reality classroom practices, case studies were constructed with four science teachers in different schools in Egypt. The main aims of this article were to provide an answer to the research question, To what extent do science teachers' beliefs correspond to their practices?' and to explore the contextual factors that can explain the difference, the consistency or inconsistency, between teachers' beliefs and practices. The study collected data for each teacher using semi-structured interviews, notes taken while observing classes, and teachers' notes, journals, and lesson plans concerned with STS lessons. The data were analysed using the constant comparative method around common themes, which were identified as distinctive features of teachers' beliefs; these same themes were then compared with their practices. Results showed that a few of the in-service science teachers' pedagogical beliefs aligned with constructivist philosophy. Some of the teachers' beliefs were consistent with their practices, especially the traditional beliefs, while some of teachers' practices were conflicted with their beliefs in different contexts.

AB Since eWOM provides a rich source of objective information about products or services, it has become one of the major ways in which consumers collect information about items they are interested in buying. However, the problem of eWOM overload makes it difficult to effectively collect this information, and may have adverse effects on their actual purchase behavior. eWOM content is characterized by unstructured text formats, oversimplified expressions, and newly coined phrases (textspeak), and these all contribute to the challenges that arise when analyzing eWOM. This study thus proposes an eWOM analysis method for analyzing eWOM, which may lead to a more effective method for analyzing eWOM content, extracting both positive and negative appraisals, and help consumers in their decision making. At the same time, the method proposed in this study can also be utilized as a tool to assist companies in better understanding product or service appraisals, thus translating these opinions into business intelligence and as the basis for product/service improvements.

AB The design of Decision Support Systems have recently emphasized web enablement as the next step in design improvements for this class of applications. We argue that these approaches fail to address the key notion of adaptability in the support for decision makers. Instead of focusing exclusively on automation in decision making, we believe it is also necessary to pay attention to the interplay between decision makers and organizational processes. The service oriented view of organizations recognizes the need to accommodate the changing reality of organizational dynamics. For example, the service science approach focuses on interactions between service providers, their clients, and consumers as important interacting components of a service system. Current approaches to DSS design are constrained in terms of their ability to adapt to changes in user requirements and to provide support for the evolution of systems. This situation worsens when resources are distributed at different locations across organizations, decision making processes are required to be integrated at different points in time, and when collaboration is needed among decision makers. However, this typically characterizes the needs of collaborative decision making in networked organizations as exemplified by systems used for supply chain management. To address these problems we leverage the power of services for designing a framework that explicitly recognizes the need for design based on service delivery. We develop an agent-enabled service-oriented architecture to realize the proposed framework with service and agent paradigms. The architecture is refined and validated with an implementation in the supply chain context. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using service-oriented decision support systems (DSS in cloud) is one of the major trends for many organizations in hopes of becoming more agile. In this paper, after defining a list of requirements for serviceoriented DSS, we propose a conceptual framework for DSS in cloud, and discus about research directions. A unique contribution of this paper is its perspective on how to servitize the product oriented DSS environment, and demonstrate the opportunities and challenges of engineering service oriented DSS in cloud. When we define data, information and analytics as services, we see that traditional measurement mechanisms, which are mainly time and cost driven, do not work well. Organizations need to consider value of service level and quality in addition to the cost and duration of delivered services. DSS in CLOUD enables scale, scope and speed economies. This article contributes new knowledge in service science by tying the information technology strategy perspectives to the database and design science perspectives for a broader audience.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate pre-service science teachers' views and knowledge of models and modeling. The data were collected from seven participants through semi-structured interviews and an open-ended questionnaire. The results indicated that variations and deficiencies existed among the participants' views and knowledge of models. The participants were unable to distinguish exclusive characteristics of scientific models. It was also found that the pre-service science teachers favored a teaching model according to model's aesthetic appeal, scientific context, and practicality. It is recommended that pre-service science teachers should engage in more modeling activities and gain more modeling experiences throughout their training programs to improve their content knowledge of models and modeling.

AB This paper describes Spanish science teachers' thinking about issues concerning the nature of science (NOS) and the relationships connecting science, technology, and society (STS). The sample consisted of 774 in-service and pre-service teachers. The participants responded to a selection of items from the Questionnaire of Opinions on Science, Technology & Society in a multiple response model. These data were processed to generate the invariant indices that are used as the bases for subsequent quantitative and qualitative analyses. The overall results reflect moderately informed conceptions, and a detailed analysis by items, categories, and positions reveals a range of positive and negative conceptions about the topics of NOS dealt with in the questionnaire items. The implications of the findings for teaching and teacher training on the themes of NOS are discussed.

AB The nature of science (NOS) has become a central goal of science education in many countries. This study sought an understanding of the extent to which a nature of science course (NOSC), designed according to the conceptualization of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for teaching nature of science (NOS), affects in-service science teachers' understanding and learning of NOS, and their orientations towards teaching it. A qualitative research approach was employed as a research methodology, drawing upon pre- and post-instruction NOS questionnaires, field notes, and in-service teachers' weekly journal entries and assignments. Open-ended NOS questionnaires, used to assess participants' understandings of NOS, were analysed and categorized as either informed, partially informed and naive. Other qualitative data were analysed through an inductive process to identify ways in-service teachers engaged and learned in the NOSC. The results indicate that at the beginning of the course, a majority of the in-service science teachers held naive understandings of NOS, particularly with respect to the definition of science, scientific inquiry, and differences between laws and theories. They viewed implicit project-based science and science process skills as goals of NOS instruction. By engaging in the course, the in-service science teachers developed an understanding of NOS and orientations to teaching NOS based on various elements, especially reflective and explicit instruction, role modelling, and content- and non-content embedded instruction. The aim of this study is to help science teacher educators, consider how to support and develop science teachers' understandings of NOS while being mindful of PCK for NOS, and develop methods for teaching NOS frameworks.

AB While the service economy is growing very fast, more organizations are reorienting their processes, tools, and products towards service-oriented applications. This service-oriented paradigm is creating new challenges and opportunities for organizations. In this article, we discuss service science and systems, and provide a conceptual view of the service ecosystem in the context of analytical, computational and conceptual modeling. As service scientists, our ultimate goal should be to develop and provide a science-based approach to the dynamic, scalable, secure, and knowledge-driven design and development of service ecosystems, while in the process fostering the development of academic researchers and industry professionals to work in diverse, interdisciplinary teams for engineering adaptable solutions to distributed computing problems.

AB The growth of service sector in recent years has led to renewed research interests in the design and management of service systems. Decision support systems (DSS) play an important role in supporting this endeavor, through management of organizational resources such as models and data, thus forming the "back stage" of service systems. In this article, we identify the requirements for semantically annotating decision models and propose a model representation scheme, termed Semantically Annotated Structure Modeling Markup Language (SA-SMML) that extends Structure Modeling Markup Language (SMML) by incorporating mechanisms for linking semantic models such as ontologies that represent problem domain knowledge concepts. This model representation format is also amenable to a scalable Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for managing models in distributed environments. The proposed model representation technique leverages recent advances in the areas of semantic web, and semantic web services. Along with design considerations, we demonstrate the utility of this representation format with an illustrative usage scenarios with a particular emphasis on model discovery and composition in a distributed environment.

TI Marketing Managers' Perceptions of Value Cocreation
SO SERVICE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE cocreation of value; service-dominant logic; service science; eastern
   Europe; metacompetencies
AB Cocreation of value is a key construct in service science and the service-dominant logic. Little is known about how practicing managers perceive their own value cocreating activities. The paper is one of the first to gather manager perceptions of value cocreation activities and categorize them in terms of marketing logics. The paper offers insights on how marketing managers perceive value cocreation based on an analysis of examples of its application in practice. It responds to pleas for studies on how organizations can manage the cocreation process. Fifty-one managers of public and private sector organizations in Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia were asked to provide examples of how their organizations cocreate value with customers through marketing activities. The resulting 99 examples were classified according to perspectives contrasting the goods-and service-dominant logics. Many examples concerned marketing communications, market research, or new product development, which fit more closely with goods-dominant logic. The examples incorporating cocreation of value as espoused in the service-dominant logic involved reciprocity, high levels of trust, and knowledge sharing. Managers who are keen to adopt the notion of cocreation of value are advised to focus on the metacompetencies of education, knowledge sharing, and capacity building.

TI Optimal Return Service Charging Policy for a Fashion Mass Customization
   Program
SO SERVICE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE service science; service marketing; mass customization; uncertainties;
   consumer return
AB Mass customization (MC) service is a pertinent industrial practice in the fashion industry. To foster trust and enhance demand, some brands now allow dissatisfied customers to return the MC fashion product for a full refund minus a service charge. The service charge is a measure to avoid the abuse of the return right and to subsidize the operations cost (e. g., shipping) and loss from the return. Motivated by this observed industrial practice, this paper analytically examines the optimal return service charge policy. We separate the study into two cases-those of risk-neutral and those of risk-averse MC companies, respectively. For each case, we derive the closed-form expression of the optimal return service charge, and we conduct analytical sensitivity analysis to illustrate how different important parameters in the model affect the optimal return service charge. In addition, by comparing the two cases, we reveal how the MC service provider's level of risk aversion affects the optimal return service charge policy. Finally, we derive the conditions under which it is optimal to offer a zero return service charge (i. e., free return with a full refund). These conditions provide insight on the real-world practice in which some fashion companies offer free return service to their registered members but not to every customer.

AB The effect of different textual versions (macroscopic (control), submicroscopic, and guided imagery) of the explanation of a chemical phenomenon on students' submicroscopic explanation of a related phenomenon was examined. The sample included 152 pre-service science teachers. The three textual versions of the explanation were distributed randomly to the participants. The results revealed that students who received the submicroscopic version and those who received the guided imagery version outperformed students who received the macroscopic version. These results indicated that students' use of the submicroscopic understanding was not spontaneous and they needed to be cued to do so. Also, the submicroscopic mean scores of all three groups were low, and this might be an indication of a weak ability to: 1) translate between macroscopic and submicroscopic levels of chemistry, and 2) transfer a submicroscopic understanding of one phenomenon to another related one.

AB This study investigated the influence of metacognitive guidance on pre-service science teachers' scientific knowledge, science process skills, and views about the nature of science. The sample included 48 pre-service science teachers taking a first-year chemistry laboratory course in a public university in Turkey. During the 11-week course, the students conducted 11 experiments. Four scales were administered to a control group and an experimental group as pre- and post-tests. Differently from control group, experimental group discussed the experimental design and completed a reflection form before and after each experiment. Moreover, experimental group answered questions about daily life implications. Results indicate that the inclusion of metacognitive guidance helped the students in the experimental group to improve their process skills and conceptual understanding.

AB This paper describes an IT-driven service innovation with an in-depth case study. The case study shows the different stages of RFID implementation in the jewellery supply chain of a retailer including all stakeholders. Based on a review of the literature on service engineering, information systems and management, we propose a framework to enhance IT-driven service innovation. Service science lacks procedures, methods and tools for developing new services. The main contributions of this paper lie in proposing a framework that supports service innovation in an IT-driven case. We illustrate our framework with an in-depth case study and infer lessons that can be useful to managers who wish to duplicate IT-driven service innovation for RFID technology. This framework includes both strategic and operational dimensions to help managers anticipate key challenges and pitfalls in service innovation projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing service sector in the global economy signifies the need for applying service science to study the interdisciplinary nature of services. In particular, container shipping service is considered a key enabler of international trade and global economic development. To strengthen the role of shipping in supporting global seaborne trade, it is highly desirable to identify the determinants that influence the total capacity of the shipping industry, explain how the related business activities (e.g., demand for shipping service, vessel price, fleet size, etc.) are linked to the demand for container shipping service, and empirically verify the findings. This study builds on the demand chain management paradigm to analyze the service capacity of the container shipping industry. We establish a path-analytic model to explain how shipping demand affects such shipping-related variables as vessel price and to evaluate their effects on the service capacity of the industry. The empirically-tested model provides managers and researchers with insights on how to enhance the coordination and integration of a series of shipping-related variables from shipping demand to capacity management in the container shipping service industry.

AB Purpose - The servitization of manufacturing is a diverse and complex field of research interest. The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrative and organising lens for viewing the various contributions to knowledge production from those research communities addressing servitization. To achieve this, the paper aims to set out to address two principal questions, namely where are the knowledge stocks and flows amongst the research communities? And what are generic research concerns being addressed by these communities?
   Design/methodology/approach - Using an evidenced-based approach, the authors have performed a systematic review of the research literature associated with the servitization of manufacturing. This investigation incorporates a descriptive and thematic analysis of 148 academic and scholarly papers from 103 different lead authors in 68 international peer-reviewed journals.
   Findings - The work proposes support for the existence of distinct researcher communities, namely services marketing, service management, operations management, product-service systems and service science management and engineering, which are contributing to knowledge production in the servitization of manufacturing. Knowledge stocks within all communities associated with research in the servitization of manufacturing have dramatically increased since the mid-1990s. The trends clearly reveal that the operations community is in receipt of the majority of citations relating to the servitization of manufacturing. In terms of knowledge flows, it is apparent that the more mature communities are drawing on more locally produced knowledge stocks, whereas the emergent communities are drawing on a knowledge base more evenly distributed across all the communities. The results are indicative of varying degrees of interdependency amongst the communities. The generic research concerns being addressed within the communities are associated with the concepts of product-service differentiation, competitive strategy, customer value, customer relationships and product-service configuration.
   Originality/value - This research has further developed and articulated the identities of distinct researcher communities actively contributing to knowledge production in the servitization of manufacturing, and to what extent they are pursuing common research agendas. This study provides an improved descriptive and thematic awareness of the resulting body of knowledge, allowing the field of servitization to progress in a more informed and multidisciplinary fashion.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to link academic classifications of service innovation with practical activities by firms to detail the essence of service innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research employs both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The qualitative study features interviews with senior managers from 590 companies, covering nine industries in Taiwan, to gather practitioners' perspectives on service innovation. A content analysis details specific forms of service innovation. The quantitative study provides a homogeneity test and two-sample proportions test to examine differences in service innovation perspectives/activities across organizational characteristics.
   Findings - The interview data link three types of service innovations to 11 associated elements and 25 labels, derived from 659 potential service innovation incidents (550 new service concepts, 82 new service processes, and 27 new service business models). This study also shows that elements of service innovations vary by company size, service innovation experience, and industry life cycle.
   Practical implications - The three types of service innovations enable businesses to benchmark and modify their current service innovation activities. Service managers can use the results of this study to develop their own service innovation strategies and concrete action plans.
   Originality/value - This pioneering study links the viewpoints of academics with practical service innovation activities and empirically shows that service innovation is dissimilar, depending on various organization characteristics.

AB Purpose - Insufficient attention to the specific nature of healthy food experiences might limit the success of related innovations. The purpose of this article is to adopt a value-in-use perspective to conceptualize healthy food consumption as experiential and emotional, rather than the mere intake of nutrition, and to examine the development of healthy food communication with a service science approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - With a service science approach, this study proposes a virtual healthy food platform for children. The key data come from internal project documents, workshops with children and other stakeholders (e.g. parents, teachers), and interviews with project team members.
   Findings - The simultaneity of functional and hedonic benefits, implications for multiple stakeholders, social norms, and need for expertise characterize healthy food experiences. The proposed framework accounts for enablers, principles, outcomes, and challenges affecting the development of communication integral to healthy food experiences, using project data and tools as illustrations.
   Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to growing literature on service science by introducing key principles and contingency factors that influence the success of experience-centric service innovations. Quantitative research should validate the established framework and investigate the elements' relative usefulness for developing healthy food communication
   Practical implications - The service science approach involves multiple stakeholders, empathic data collection, and visual tools to develop an entertaining platform to help children learn about healthy food.
   Originality/value - This research conceptualizes and validates healthy food experiences as value-in-use offerings. The proposed service science approach accounts for the interactions among stakeholders, the holistic nature, and specificities of a real-life decision context for improving healthy food experiences.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the relationship among pre-service science teachers' personality traits, academic self-regulation and teaching self-efficacy by proposing and testing a conceptual model. For the specified purpose, 1794 pre-service science teachers participated in the study. The Teachers' Sense of Efficacy Scale, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory, and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire were administered to assess pre-service science teachers' teaching self-efficacy, personality, and academic self-regulation respectively. Results showed that agreeableness, neuroticism, performance approach goals, and use of metacognitive strategies are positively linked to different dimensions of teaching self-efficacy, namely self-efficacy for student engagement, instructional strategies, and classroom management. In general, while agreeableness and neuroticism were found to be positively associated with different facets of self-regulation and teaching self-efficacy, openness was found to be negatively linked to these adaptive outcomes.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate pre-service science teachers' understanding of surface tension, cohesion and adhesion forces by using computer-mediated predict-observe-explain tasks. 22 third-year pre-service science teachers participated in this study. Three computer-mediated predicto-bserve-explain tasks were developed and applied to collect data. In the first stage of each task, pre-service science teachers were required to watch video related to the aforementioned concepts. They were asked to write their predictions individually, and to justify or give a reason for their predictions. In the second stage, pre-service science teachers were required to watch the continued video carefully. They recorded their observations individually. In the last stage, the pre-service science teachers were required to reconcile any conflict between their own predictions and observations. Their written responses were analysed to investigate their understanding. Results indicated that pre-service science teachers had difficulties related to surface tension, cohesion and adhesion forces. The obtained results underlined that the computer-mediated predict-observe-explain task was an effective method to diagnose students' understanding.

AB Purpose - The evolution of the service marketing field was marked by the emergence of a global, vigorous and tolerant community of service marketing researchers. This paper seeks to examine the history of the service marketing community and argues that it may be an archetype for building the emergent global service research community
   Design/methodology/approach - The study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. The authors interviewed four pioneering service scholars and also collected descriptive data (e.g. Authorship, Affiliation, Title, Keywords) of all service related articles published in 13 top peer-reviewed marketing and service journals over the last 30 years (5,432 articles; 6,450 authors). In a dynamic analysis the authors mapped global collaboration between countries over time and detected clusters of international collaboration.
   Findings - Findings suggest a growing international collaboration for the USA and the UK, while for other countries like Israel the global collaboration started from a high level and decreases now. Further, the service marketing community never became polarized and there were always contributions from researchers all over the world.
   Research limitations/implications - As the global service research community is developing, service marketing becomes a research neighborhood within the broader service research community. Simultaneously, other research neighborhoods are emerging within this new community (e.g. service arts, service management, service engineering, service science).
   Originality/value - Anchored on the social evolution and biological evolution metaphors, this study explains the evolution of the service marketing field from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Furthermore, it explains the development of the service marketing community as an archetype for building the global service research community.

AB The purpose of this study is to explore pre-service secondary science teachers' images of themselves as science teachers. Also, the association between instructional style, and domains was explored. 130 secondary science teachers (biology, chemistry and physics) from 26 public universities participated in the data collection for this study. The Draw a Science Teacher Test Checklist (DASTT-C) was used as a data collection instrument. The results of study showed that pre-service science teachers' images is 24.62% student-centred, 53.85% between student and teacher-centred, and 21.4% teacher-centred teaching style approaches. A significant association was found between domain and instructional style. Pre-service chemistry teachers were more willing to use student-centred teaching style rather than pre-service biology and pre-service physics teachers.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of concept cartoon worksheets, gender and their interaction on pre-service science teachers' conceptual understanding of geometrical optics. Participants were 121 sophomore students from four intact classes. A quasi-experimental design was used as the research method. The experimental group studied geometrical optics with implementation of concept cartoon worksheets prepared in consideration with a constructivist view of learning while the control group studied the lesson unit with traditional instruction. Students' conceptual understandings of geometrical optics were measured by a tree-tier misconception test. The main effects of treatment, gender and their interactions on post-test scores were examined via ANCOVA test. The analysis yielded that the worksheets produced a statistically significant treatment effect; however, gender and gender*treatment interaction effect on students' post-test performances were not significant.

DE Service system; Service classification; Service description frameworks

AB There are many different normative frameworks for describing service systems that take a distinct conceptual perspective. They emphasize the physical arrangement or topology, the functions or processes, the chronology of experience, the causality of value creation, the flow of information or people, or other characteristics. These frameworks are deeply embedded in service system research and design practice, but we have not known how useful or natural they are. University students new to service science concepts described a service system they all usedthe Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. They identified and categorized the services they encountered or that were involved when they used BART and then created diagrams to depict the system. There was substantial variation in how students described BART in terms of scope, overall number of services, and their granularity. There was also great diversity in the classification of services and in the diagrams or other representations students created. Since most students had little exposure to normative frameworks for describing service systems, their diagrams were often hybrids of different frameworks. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Over the past 50 years, the service sector has grown in most advanced industrialized economies to be the dominant economic activity. Researchers are working to understand service activities and define scientific concepts and methods of service under an emerging research area called service science. Service is defined as the application of competence and knowledge to create value. Value is realized through interactions and cocreation among service systems. Service systems vary in scope (from individuals to businesses, organizations, governments, and nations) and adapt dynamically and connect to other service systems through value propositions. The service system has been proposed as an abstraction for service science, and yet it is not clear how to characterize a given organization as a service system. In this article, we present a review of literature on service system concepts and define a service system framework developed from the literature that can be used to characterize an organization as a service system.

AB Service science is an emerging multidisciplinary field concerned with the study of service systems and value cocreation. In recent years, the field has expanded considerably, growing to encompass a community of researchers and practitioners from a range of backgrounds and knowledge domains. However, very little research has focused on the study of service systems within the context of social-purpose organizations (SPOs), such as a nonprofit charitable organization or an academic institution. We contend that SPOs represent a class of service systems that are understudied in service science. The goal of this study is to contribute to the ongoing development of the discipline's theoretical foundations through an empirical study of a special type of SPO, the social enterprise. Through case-study research, we analyzed five social enterprise organizations. Our findings point to a number of areas that suggest a bias in service science concepts toward economically motivated and profit-driven service systems. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Even though one of the prerequisites of inquiry-based science classes is acquiring measuring skills, there is not enough emphasis in the schools today on developing these skills. The current study, which has been designed with the thought that this situation may be caused by the fact that teachers do not have a sufficient level of measurement skills, aims to clarify knowledge of some basic quantities (length, mass, weight, volume, temperature and time), create awareness about fundamental skills in measuring related quantities, and develop these basic skills for the benefit of pre-service science teachers (n=73). The experimental study, which has been designed using a mixed research methodology, includes both qualitative and quantitative research methods, uses a skill-observation form and researcher observation notes, as well as pre-test, post-test and retention tests. This research, which focuses on developing measurement activities, reveals the importance of not only knowledge and skill integration but also of continuity in teaching measuring skills. In addition, recommendations have been set forth for the effective use of measurement tools in basic science education courses and some measurement activities have been suggested.

AB Problem Statement: Increasing global population and unrestrained consumption of natural resources has resulted in increasing pollution, poor air and water quality and the extinction of animal and plant species. Today, environmental problems are experienced worldwide and threatening the continuity of human life. For the sake of human beings, environmental problems need to be solved in the near future. Solving environmental problems is only possible with citizens who are knowledgeable about environmental issues, aware of environmental problems, and motivated to work to solve these problems. Environmental education is the most effective way to educate children about these issues. Teachers are the key actors who shape children's interest in and attitudes toward environmental issues. Thus, for environmental education researchers, it is always worth studying in-service and pre-service teachers' environmental attitudes.
   Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study is to investigate Turkish pre-service science teachers' attitudes toward the environment. In addition, it aims to investigate how pre-service science teachers' environmental attitudes change with grade level and gender.
   Method: A total of 2015 pre-service teachers enrolled at elementary school science education departments at 13 different universities in Turkey participated in the study. A 45-item Likert-type questionnaire consisting of four dimensions, namely, awareness of environmental problems, general attitudes toward solutions, awareness of individual responsibility, and awareness of national environmental problems, was used to measure pre-service teachers' environmental attitudes. Descriptive statistics; frequency distributions and percentages, and inferential statistics; independent samples t-test and analysis of variance, were used to determine pre-service teachers' environmental attitudes.
   Findings and Results: The results of the study showed that pre-service science teachers have a high level of environmental attitudes (M = 149.67, SD = 12.10). The results also revealed that there is a statistically significant mean difference (t ((2006)) = 2.861, p = .004) between males and females in favour of females with a small effect size (eta(2) = .004). The results also showed that there are no significant differences (F (3, 2011) = 2.466, p = .061) between pre-service teachers enrolling to different grades with respect to their environmental attitudes.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: Overall, the results of the study indicated that today's pre-service science teachers have positive attitudes toward the environment. Additionally, it was found that females have more positive attitudes toward the environment than males. The gender difference in favour of females may be due to the cultural roles of males and females. In traditional views of gender roles, females are responsible for looking after their children and males are usually responsible for providing the economic wellbeing of the family. As a result of these gender roles, males become more competitive and females become more protective, and thus may show more positive attitudes toward the environment. Based on these results, it is suggested that environmental education provided through all steps of formal education take gender differences into account.

DE Pre-service teacher education; video training; ability to notice
   teaching strategies; field experience
ID CLUB
AB Problem Statement: Student teaching is an integral part of teacher education. While it provides pre-service teachers with real classroom experience, though, it is limited in that it does not provide shared experience. Used as instructional tools, videos provide a shared common experience in a controlled environment to pre-service teachers in teacher education. Video use as a part of teacher education requires that student teachers be skilled in observation and ability to notice. However, in many cases, pre-service teachers' observation skills and ability to discern the effects of different strategies are neither questioned nor investigated.
   Purpose of Study: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of video use on pre-service teachers' ability to observe and evaluate teaching practices and explore how that ability develops.
   Methods: This study was conducted with the participation of 26 senior pre-service science and technology teachers who were enrolled in a teacher practice course during the fall semester of their fourth-year undergraduate education program. Three different videos were used as instructional tools; participating pre-service teachers were asked to evaluate the teaching practice in each video. A three-item questionnaire was used for data collection purposes.
   Findings and Results: The findings of the study suggest that, initially, pre-service teachers failed to notice details and were only partially able to recognize the main features of a teaching practice. Most participant comments focused on what the teacher was doing rather than on students. As time progressed, participants' ability to notice instructional strategies was found to be developed through use of videos.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: Through use of videos, pre-service teachers' selective attention and ability to perceive details of a teaching practice was found to be improved. Since the ability to notice is an important skill for novice teachers, based on the finding of this study, video use is recommended as a part of teacher education.

AB In recent times, Taiwan's grade 1-9 science curriculum has been undergoing landmark reform that emphasizes continuity between elementary and secondary school science, integration among different science subjects, and connections between textbooks and students' life experiences. School teachers are expected to grow professionally to meet the new challenges that have arisen from this reform. This study intends to investigate how in-service science teachers grow professionally in a collaborative professional development project based on an interactive development/improvement model operating on the principles of diversity and equal partnership. A group of science teachers and university experts with diverse backgrounds collaborated on a two-year curriculum development project. We collected and analyzed various types of qualitative data, using interviews, videotapes of discussions, and written reflections. The results show that this model succeeded in enabling teachers to grow professionally as curriculum developers and active leaders. We found that diversity and equal partnership were the key factors responsible for the success of this project, and believe the two factors should be taken into account when creating teacher professional development programs.

AB Recognising the importance of value-creating systems in action is vital for understanding how value is co-created through resource integration and mutual service provision. Value-creating systems are inherently dynamic and grounded in on-going human action. This article adopts structuration and enactment theory to enhance insights into how complex systems enable value co-creation. The concept of embeddedness (structural, cultural, political and cognitive) clarifies the duality of complex service system structures, in which behaviour and structure are intertwined through a process of socialisation. Actors in a complex service system act on the surrounding context and interpret the contextual responses of their actions through a sense-making process. The sensemaking process then influences an actor's mental models of the value that has been co-created, which implies a complex service system that has been socially constructed through negotiation and consensually validated through its own enactment. This study applies the framework to a case setting focused on fear of crime in the London Borough of Sutton. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban centers face complex challenges in managing their services to continually improve their citizens' quality of life. They also face complex challenges in managing citizens' perceptions of the effectiveness of services to continually improve their resulting quality of life. We view urban areas as dynamic sociocultural systems, meaning that effectively and dynamically understanding and addressing their challenges means confronting the full complexity of factors that interact to make up the system. More precisely, we understand these systems to be complex service systems, arrangements of multiple entities and stakeholders that interact to co-create value. Decision makers of urban centers face the design problem of arranging the entities so that the most mutual value emerges from their interactions. To analyze and understand such complex systems, we suggest a new approach to service system analysis based on model composition to design and evaluate stakeholder relationships through what-if scenarios. Applied to the intriguing real-world scenario of crime and perceptions of crime in the London Borough of Sutton, we show how service system analysis - analyzing value constellations to find opportunities for reconfiguring roles and relationships that unlock value - can be applied to a sociocultural service system by focusing on the complex relationship among components that can influence complex questions, such as safety and quality-of-community. Modeling and simulating the value constellations of complex service systems can help us discover which interventions and reconfigurations will be effective and which will not. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ORGANIZATIONS; FUNDAMENTALS; SCIENCE
AB The aim of this paper is to propose a systems interpretation of the concept of complexity and its implications for a theoretical discussion of the concept of boundary in complex service systems. The proposal highlights the interpretative contribution of a dual perspective of observation that distinguishes between a structure-based view and a systems-based view. When dealing with complexity, the phenomenon under investigation cannot be addressed through management approaches that aim to measure and control it in a vain attempt to find the best solution. Due to the inner nature of complexity, a more rewarding approach to a full understanding of problematic situations should place consolidated management models within a more general interpretation framework that suggests preliminary insights about the real nature of the investigated phenomenon.
   First, this paper outlines the theoretical background of the literature on service, service systems and complex service systems, providing evidence of the contribution of recent service research advances such as service science and service-dominant logic. Next, the paper focuses on the basic principles of systems thinking to introduce the Viable Systems Approach (vSa) as a general framework of reference for both the investigation and the governance of social organisations.
   The vSa conceptual framework is adopted for proposing some reflections from a systems perspective in the investigation of the case of the London Borough of Sutton (LBS). The focus is on interpreting the paradoxical situation of an increased fear of crime among LBS residents despite the evidence of reduction in the crime rate. Although the incidence has fallen for most types of crimes, a recent poll confirmed that crime is still rated as the most important issue for residents. Therefore, improving safety and reducing crime remain the top priorities for the Safer Sutton Partnership Service. In short, this study proposes to consider "reducing the fear of crime in a community" as a complex service system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Saturday Science Academy (SSA) was designed to improve elementary and middle school students' interests and excitement in science and consists of several hands-on activities. The purpose of this paper is to report the findings of the SSA programs. It was offered in two consecutive semesters. A Nature of Science questionnaire and Science Interest pre- and post- tests results are investigated. The first semester was designed for students in the 6th grade and the second semester was offered to 3rd grade students. This project was administered at a mid-size university campus in the fall semester of 2010 and the spring semester 2011. Twelve students met in a physics lab on six consecutive Saturday mornings for certain chosen physics topics in the first semester. In the second semester, 15 students met for six weeks. This project enhanced students' research and experimentation skills and self-development process; these are not provided for during regular school settings. During the study, two former science teachers, graduate students in the science education program, taught various topics and levels of science courses in the SSA. Pre-service science teachers enrolled in the science education preparation program assisted them in preparing materials and conducting science activities. The initial results of this study revealed that the Saturday Science Academy not only enhanced students' interests but also increased their knowledge of the nature of science.

AB The main purpose of this study is to explore preservice science teachers' mental models of science teaching. Additionally it is investigated whether there is a significant correlation between their gender and grade levels in terms of mental models. The sample of this study composed of 300 (111 males and 189 females) pre-service science teachers from Turkey. As a data collection instrument "Draw a Science Teacher Test-Checklist (DASTT-C)" was used. The test was made up two sections. In the first section of the DASTT-C, the pre-service science teachers were asked to "Draw a picture of yourself as a science teacher". In the second section, they were asked to give answers to the questions "What is the science teacher doing? and what are the students doing?" regarding their drawings. The data was the coded according to the rubric and analyzed with SPSS. The results of study showed that pre-service science teachers' mental models of science teaching were in the categories of conceptual teaching (61%), exploratory or inquiry/constructivist teaching (22%), and explicit/didactic teaching (17%). There was no significant difference between male and female but there was significant difference between the grade levels in favour of senior levels with regard to their mental models of science teaching. In the light of the results, some suggestions were made for further studies.

AB Facing changes in the medical environment, community pharmacies are seeking new strategies and developing new services in order to survive. In this two-phase study, we explored certain aspects of service development in community pharmacies. The first phase involved collection of qualitative data through interviews. In the second phase, a quantitative study was designed on the basis of the results of interviews conducted in the first phase, and sampling was conducted using a questionnaire. The results of the qualitative study showed that development of community pharmacies could enhance public health services and the pharmacy profession and facilitate a redesign of the service environment. In the quantitative study, over 64% of the respondents agreed that development of community pharmacies would enhance the pharmacy professional environment and provide flexible and diversified services. Another 95% of the respondents were able to accept the concept of self-care management systems that are based on public health services provided by community pharmacies. Regarding the redesign of the service environment of community pharmacies, 42% of the respondents reported that this is 'important', and 53% indicated that this is 'very important'.

AB Service is about value cocreation between customers and providers. Cocreation builds on human networking: people connecting fluidly with each other as customers, providers, and resources to pursue common values. This paper develops a new analysis of service value networks, building on a previously presented hypernetwork model to study how people can scale their value cocreation up to span the entire population (domain), down to meet individual needs, and transformationally to breed new business designs. The new analysis reflects the convergence of social networks and e-commerce, and the evolution of physical products toward incorporating services to users into them (such as the apps and digital resources on the iPod, iPhone, and iPad). The hypernetwork model analyzes human networks that overlay multidimensionally, such as the Internet community itself. These properties extend the previous research results on random graphs and semiregular networks. A simulation study helps verify the hypernetworking analysis.

AB The ability of information technologies (ITs) to integrate activities and offerings across multiple channels offers a promising opportunity for retail firms to enhance their relationship with their customers and firm performance. Consumers value the flexibility to learn about the available offerings, complete their orders and obtain customer service across different channels in a convenient and integrated manner. Therefore, the retail industry has begun to use IT extensively to automate and integrate business processes across their traditional and online channels. This study examines the impacts of the use of IT by retail firms in integrating channel activities for selling to customers. Our research model argues that retail channel integration through IT should enhance the efficiency and innovation of a retail firm. In turn, these improvements should enhance their overall performance. We also propose that the environmental dynamism would moderate the effects of improvements in efficiency and innovation on firm performance. We draw upon recent theories in organizational resource integration and organizational learning to develop our research model and hypotheses. Based on survey data from 125 multichannel retailers in Singapore, we find that retail channel integration through the use of IT allows firms to not only be efficient in delivering the current offerings, but also be innovative in creating future offerings. Further, we find that environmental dynamism does positively moderate the effects of innovation ability on performance. Our results provide managerial insights for firms involved in digital integration not only in the retail sector but also in other service industries. These findings could also serve as a foundation for further research on service operations management for firms with both physical and online operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Collaboration among businesses is needed to successfully fulfill a given task and goal. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been regarded as an efficient platform to support flexible interoperability among various enterprises by discovering, selecting and composing services. However, since a large number of enterprises have been participating in this SOA platform, relationships among these enterprises are getting too complicated to obtain flexibility and scalability for efficient collaboration. Thereby, in this paper, we propose a dynamic SOA platform to discover service chains for building ad hoc enterprise alliances where the only relevant enterprises are sorted out and merged. As a result, given an event, decision makers can find out which enterprises (and services from the enterprises) might be selected for their collaboration. The proposed SOA platform has been applied to mobile advertisement application as a case study. With respect to two indicators (i.e., precision and agility), we have shown that the proposed SOA outperforms traditional enterprise collaboration schemes.

AB This paper applies the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in calculating the weights and uses Cause-Effect Grey Relational Analysis (CEGRA) to rank system performance based on multiple criteria evaluation. AHP is compared with CEGRA in ranking the alternatives, thus achieving improved environmentally friendly system performance. This paper uses the TFT-LCD chiller in Taiwan to measure the model's reliability and validity through comparison with the traditional strengths and weaknesses assessment. Businesses should cooperate with collaborative vendors and apply the service science management concept to improve performance and reduce energy waste. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concepts of diffusion and osmosis cross the disciplinary boundaries of physics, chemistry and biology. They are important for understanding how biological systems function. Since future (pre-service) science teachers in Slovenia encounter both concepts at physics, chemistry and biology courses during their studies, we assessed the first-, second- and third-year science teachers' understanding of diffusion and osmosis using a diffusion and osmosis diagnostic test. We found that the knowledge of first-year pre-service science teachers about diffusion and osmosis was largely superficial. Second-and third-year students achieved better test scores; however, not as high as we had anticipated. We also found that the pre-service teachers who had actively approached the concepts (e.g. conducted experiments) of diffusion and osmosis in upper secondary school achieved significantly higher test scores.

AB Science teachers need an adequate understanding of nature of science (NOS) and the ability to embed NOS in their teaching. This collective case study aims to explore in-service science teachers' conceptions of NOS and the embeddedness of NOS in their teaching about astronomy and space. Three science teachers participated in this study. All participants attended the NOS workshop based on an explicit-reflective approach. They were asked to respond to the Myths of Science Questionnaire on three different occasions, i.e., at the beginning and the end of the NOS workshop and a semester after the workshop. Classroom observation, interviews after teaching, and a collection of related documents were also employed to collect data. The data were analyzed using a constant comparative method. The results revealed two important assertions. First, science teachers' conceptions of NOS are stable and resistant to change. However, an explicit-reflective approach employed in the NOS workshop, to some extent, promoted science teachers' understanding and reasoning about NOS. Second, science teachers' conceptions of NOS are not directly related to their classroom practices. With different degrees of NOS understanding, all participants taught NOS implicitly and missed most of the opportunities to address aspects of NOS embedded in the topics they taught. The implications of these findings are also discussed.

AB The roles of customers from passive users to collaborators in creating and extracting business value have given rise to customer co-creation techniques and value co-creation models. Although these techniques and models have been useful to researchers and businesses, they are unstructured. A classification is necessary so that research can be placed in proper context of one another. Via an examination of the literature and based on the concept of customer value hierarchy a classification of the different models and techniques of co-creation is developed. There are two implications for the classification. Firstly, it will aid in the research and understanding of the use of the various techniques and models. Secondly, it can assist in designing appropriate encounter processes as a basis for engaging customers and subsequently provide innovation for organizations. The paper concludes with an application of the classification to develop encounter processes in a learning management system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes our efforts in developing the MAGDAIRE framework (abbreviated from Modeled Analysis, Guided Development, Articulated Implementation, and Reflected Evaluation) to transform pre-service science teachers' roles in a teacher education course: moving pre-service teachers from the roles of passive users of technology, as they themselves learn technology integration, into active designers of technology. The results suggested that MAGDAIRE significantly improved the pre-service teachers' technology competency levels. Moreover, MAGDAIRE facilitated the pre-service teachers' critical reexamination of the affordances of technology for their teaching practices from the views of subject matter selection, motivation empowerment, information presentation, activity design, and pedagogy transition.

AB This study aims to determine the effect of activities developed in line with the 5E learning model, which is based on the constructivist approach to instruction, on pre-service science teachers' achievement in the subject of solutions. The sample consisted of a total of 49 science undergraduates enrolled in the Department of Science Teacher Training in Bayburt Faculty of Education, Bayburt University. Two pre-existing classes were assigned randomly as control (25) and experimental groups (24). For four weeks, the subject of solutions was taught using the 5E learning model in the experimental group, and using the traditional approach to teaching in the control group. Data was gathered using informal observation and a 20-item achievement test on solutions, developed by the researcher. Quantitative data were statistically analyzed using t- test. The results of this analysis showed that there is a statistically significant difference between experimental and control groups with respect to Pre-Service Science Teachers' achievement in the subject of solutions, in favor of the experimental group, indicating that activities based on 5E learning model significantly improved students' learning of solutions, compared to conventional instruction. In addition, supporting the quantitative results, observation data indicated that activities based on the 5E model can be efficiently implemented in science classes and make a significant contribution to student's learning and retention.

AB This research paper investigates questioning styles of pre-service primary and science class teachers and suggests how questioning styles can be adapted to the goals of inquiry-based science education in Turkey. The present research was conducted in one of the Black Sea Region universities in Turkey between 2005 and 2007 in five school semesters. Participants were pre-service science and primary class teachers (N=119). The participants chose one biology topic from a science textbook and presented it to their peers by use of one of the questioning styles. Presentations were videotaped, transcribed, and translated into English. Cognitive levels of the questions were evaluated in the frame of the Bloom Taxonomy and Elstgeest's Classification. Also each semester one participant was interviewed regarding his/her perception over questioning styles (N=5). Interviews were semi-structured. The findings show that participants mostly tempt to use yes/no questions and hesitate to employ how questions. Questions are generally asked haphazardly without any logical order. Mostly questions are narrow. The present study gives some practical suggestions to develop questioning styles in accordance with the goals of inquiry-based science education. The results are also discussed and concluded in the frame of new science education curriculum.

AB Every aspect of teaching, including the instructional method, the course content, and the types of assessments, is influenced by teachers' attitudes and beliefs. Teacher education programs play an important role in the development of beliefs regarding teaching and learning. The purpose of the study was to document pre-service teachers' views on science, scientists, and science teaching as well as the relations between these views and the offered courses over several years spent in an elementary science teacher training program. The sample consisted of 145 pre-service elementary science teachers who were being trained to teach general science to students in the 6th through 8th grades. The research design was a cross-sectional study. Three different instruments were used to collect the data, namely, the "Draw a Scientist Test", "Draw a Science Teacher Test", and "Students' Views about Science" tests. The elementary science teacher training program influenced pre-service science teachers' views about science, scientists and science teaching to different degrees. The most pronounced impact of the program was on views about science teaching. Participants' impressions of science teaching changed from teacher-centered views to student-centered ones. In contrast, participants' views about scientists and science did not change much. This result could be interpreted as indicating that science teacher training programs do not change views about science and scientists but do change beliefs regarding teaching science.

AB in this study. a scale entitled "Information and Communication Technologies Usage and Material Design Efficacy [ICT_MDE](") is developed to investigate pre-service science and technology teachers' efficacy beliefs regarding ICT usage and Material Design and the factors impacting these beliefs By using the validity and reliability data from 310 pre-service teachers. ICT_MDE scale is concluded to be a valid and reliable instrument consisting of two factors: Basic ICT Skills and Original Material Design. Based on the data from this pilot study, the efficacy levels in Basic ICT Skills factor significantly changed by the income level and computer usage experience. However, efficacy scores in Original Material Design factor are found to differ only by computer usage experience. Furthermore, no significant difference due to gender has been observed in both factors.

AB This paper is about service productivity and perceived service quality. Both a high service productivity and a high customer perceived quality are two main drivers of good performances in service companies and they simultaneously occur as a consequence of a synergy of several drivers such as employees' competences and motivation, organizational efficiency, technical devices availability, information technologies employment, etc. In scientific literature a trade-off between productivity and perceived service quality is asserted and several cases derived both by market observations and academic research could bear such trade-off out. But, is it possible to state that, under some circumstances, such a trade-off between productivity and perceived service quality could be avoided? And if yes, why such certified substitution should not work?
   In this paper, in order to trace some theoretical answer to the above questions, a managerial model based both on service science and production economics will be proposed. The model aims to find out some key causes that allow to explain the foundations of the mentioned trade-off and the potential conditions for its overcoming; moreover, such model will be employed in order to integrate services' productivity function with new variables and to provide some managerial guidelines for improving service management.

AB There is an increasing need for a theory-based and industry-oriented framework for service innovation in both research and practice. However the study of service innovation has been somewhat limited. This paper applies two models of complexity theory (Kauffman's NK model in biology and organizational ambidexterity in organization science) for service innovation and proposes a novel perspective on service innovation as an evolutionary process, which is interactive, local, unpredictable, and emergent. The paper also proposes a typology of service innovation that includes eight different strategic orientations of service innovation; also included are illustrations from a knowledge-intensive service industry, particularly the IT-based consulting and service industry sector. Drawing from this complexity theory perspective, the paper discusses numerous implications for future conceptualization of service, multidimensionality of service innovation, and service innovation strategies.

ID ONLINE; STUDENTS
AB The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework has been used to prepare pre-service science teachers at the Public Authority of Applied Education and Training in Kuwait for ICT integration in education. Pre-service teachers worked in teams to design an ICT solution for an authentic problem they faced during in-school training. Pre-service teachers were separated into two groups. The first group was coached by ICT, pedagogy, and content experts. The second group was offered a blended condition, by which they had access to an online portal with different tutorials and examples, with opportunities to meet with different experts whenever they wanted. Pre-test and post-test design data were collected for attitudes toward ICT, ICT skills, and TPACK. The findings show that the self-reported TPACK, the score of attitudes toward ICT, and ICT skills increased in both groups. However, the blended support condition reported a higher increase in the participants' technological knowledge (TK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), their attitude toward ICT as a tool for instruction and productivity, and ICT enjoyment. This indicated that students perceived the blended condition for supporting design teams as a more desirable method for enhancing their development of TPACK.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer a reflective account of the emergence of new marketing theory as seen through the lens of the Nordic School of Service.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on documents and the authors' self-lived history and current involvement ("management action research").
   Findings - Northern European scholars, especially from Finland and Sweden, have felt free to design their own theory, at the same time collaborating internationally. Contributions include an early alert to services and business-to-business (B2B) marketing being neglected; dissatisfaction with service quality; that the service economy is more than the service sector; and the insight that relationship marketing and many-to-many network marketing better represent service reality. A novel service logic abandoning the divisive goods/services, B2B/B2C (business-to-consumer), and supplier/customer categories, based on commonalities and interdependencies is arriving. Nordic School methodology is characterised by induction, case study research, and theory generation, to better address complexity and ambiguity in favour of validity and relevance. In the 2000s, the synthesis provided by service-dominant (S-D) logic, IBM's service science, and network and systems theory have inspired a lively international dialogue.
   Research limitations/implications - The hegemony of the marketing management of mass-manufactured consumer goods was challenged when services entered the marketing agenda in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s the differences been goods marketing and service marketing were explored and the understanding for relationships, networks and interaction developed. It gradually laid the ground for the integrated goods/services approach that is now the major challenge for service researchers and practitioners alike.
   Originality/value - It is unfortunate if developments of marketing in the USA are perceived as a universal standard for marketing. By studying contributions from many cultures and nations in other countries the paper enhances the understanding of the diversity of marketing. This article presents such a case from Northern Europe.

AB In this paper, we describe the Scientific Habits of Mind Survey (SHOMS) developed to explore public, science teachers', and scientists' understanding of habits of mind (HoM). The instrument contained 59 items, and captures the seven SHOM identified by Gauld. The SHOM was validated by administration to two cohorts of pre-service science teachers: primary science teachers with little science background or interest (n = 145), and secondary school science teachers (who also were science graduates) with stronger science knowledge (n = 145). Face validity was confirmed by the use of a panel of experts and a pilot study employing participants similar in demographics to the intended sample. To confirm convergent and discriminant validity, confirmatory factor analysis and evaluation of the reliability were calculated. Statistical data and other data gathered from interviews suggest that the SHOMS will prove to be a useful tool for educators and researchers who wish to investigate HoM for a variety of participants.

AB This study investigated pre-service science teachers' (PSTs') moral reasoning patterns and the factors underlying these reasoning patterns. Local and non-local environmental dilemmas were used to examine moral reasoning patterns. An explanatory design was used with the collection and analysis of quantitative data, which was subsequently refined using qualitative interview data. For the quantitative part of the study, PSTs were asked to comment on four local and non-local environmental dilemmas (i.e. deforestation, e-waste, oil spills, and global warming). The responses were categorized as ecocentric, anthropocentric, or non-environmental reasoning. The findings showed that the participants' moral reasoning focused on both ecocentric and anthropocentric perspectives, with a few displaying non-environmental reasoning. Concern for environmental problems was related to perceptions of whether the issue was directly related to nature, and was independent of whether the issues were local or non-local. The Moral Decision Making Interview protocol was used in the qualitative part of the study. Analysis revealed that the participants' moral decisions were based on their resolutions in situational context and their concerns showed variations in their moral reasoning due to different factors like, effect on human life, formal principles, notion of rights, moral emotions, potential harm to others, and popular culture.

AB Purpose - The paper aims to contribute to ongoing research which emphasises the expanding role of information systems and information technology (IS/IT) as an enhancer of service delivery.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to explore the practical utilisation of IS/IT in the enhancement of service delivery, a case study was adopted as the preferred research methodology. The case focused on one of the biggest telecommunications IS/IT service providers in the UK.
   Findings - The study shows that the delivery of service experiences to customers by firms operating in service provider-intensive environments is challenged by the multi-dimensional nature of service.
   Practical implications - The interest lies in the question of the "true" role of IS/IT in service delivery. In particular, the paper explores key thematic elements that underlie enhanced IS/IT delivery.
   Originality/value - Exploration of the utilisation of IS/IT to enhance service delivery is framed within extant services science and service research literature.

AB The ability of services to pervade all aspects of productivity creates the need for an interdisciplinary framework of service to be developed. It is, however, critical that any proposed service framework is jointly developed between the service purveyor and the stakeholders involved. An expected outcome from a focus on productivity in the Service Science arena is that a much closer relationship between the purveyor of a service and the customer is initiated and fostered. This requires a clear focus on the requirements of the customer and the various ways in which the service can be conveyed. This is not too far removed from what is required in other areas such as product specification that should also be carefully crafted from the needs of the customer. The research utilises two case studies to highlight the impact of Service Science as a co-producer of service productivity. We find from the case studies that human factors play an extremely important role in improving service productivity.

AB Service science emphasises the process of value co-creation within relationships. This frames the importance of service quality and its outcomes to business-to-business (B2B) interaction. This exploratory paper investigates the dimensions of service encounter quality in B2B relationships and its effect on (dis)satisfaction. Purchasers are sampled from America and Canada who are in extended relationships with suppliers. Qualitative data are in the form of critical incidents that code to 272 critical judgements of these purchasers' perceptions of their suppliers. Findings reveal eight dimensions of service encounter quality: basic capability, relationship, communication, attitude, specification conformance, time and money, flexibility and resolution. The findings reveal how service encounter quality impacts (dis) satisfaction in a way that provides insight for suppliers in managing impacts of investment in service.

AB This article contributes to the emerging discipline of service science through an empirical investigation of value propositions as connections between service systems. The starting point for our research is that service science is an interdisciplinary approach to the study, design and implementation of service systems, a service system being considered a dynamic configuration of resources (people, technology, organisations and shared information) that create and deliver value between the provider and the customer through service (IfM and IBM 2008). Specifically, this article investigates value propositions in the context of equipment-based service systems. Our qualitative findings identify three value proposition cycles: Recovery, Availability and Outcome. In so doing, showing that providers offer three distinct propositions of value with three different primary transformations. This research contributes to theory in service systems by identifying value propositions as multiple, simultaneous and iterative connections between provider and customer systems.

ID EDUCATION; CURRICULUM; FUTURE
AB The purpose of this article is to describe a best practice: an approach to teaching chemistry that our quantitative research has shown to produce large differences between experimental and control groups in terms of achievement, pro-environmental attitudes, values, and motivation. Our interest in teaching chemistry by focusing on sustainable development arises from the environmental concerns that as the country of this study, Malaysia is facing in many different areas-including rampant logging and pollution. As educators, we are interested in educating future generations so that they can cope with the environmental challenges that not only this nation but also the world as a whole is increasingly facing. The "green chemistry" approach we describe here may be just the answer that other developing nations and emergent economies in closing the gap with industrialized nations. We provide a detailed description of how green chemistry has been implemented in a curriculum for pre-service science teachers and in the curriculum of secondary school chemistry.

AB Service research has been slowly evolving for more than 40 years. At the start of the twenty-first century some of the assumptions about the behaviour of services have become more fragile in the context of increased global economic dependencies and whether it is now realistic to treat them as a discrete set of activities. The embedding of services into seamless production chains characteristic of a 'manuservice' economy points to new challenges for a research agenda that is less focused on services per se. The components of a possible research agenda are many and varied, reflecting different disciplinary priorities or the rise of the new field of service science. Those outlined in this paper are offered from the perspective of an economic geographer.

AB Character and values are the essential driving forces that serve as general guides or points of reference for individuals to support decision-making and to act responsibly about global socioscientific issues (SSIs). Based on this assumption, we investigated to what extent pre-service science teachers (PSTs) of South Korea possess character and values as global citizens; these values include ecological worldview, socioscientific accountability, and social and moral compassion. Eighteen PSTs participated in the SSI programs focusing on developing character and values through dialogical and reflective processes. SSIs were centered on the use of nuclear power generation, climate change, and embryonic stem cell research. The results indicated that PSTs showed three key elements of character and values, but failed to apply consistent moral principles on the issues and demonstrated limited global perspectives. While they tended to approach the issues with emotion and sympathy, they nonetheless failed to perceive themselves as major moral agents who are able to actively resolve large-scale societal issues. This study also suggests that the SSI programs can facilitate socioscientific reasoning to include abilities such as recognition of the complexity of SSIs, examine issues from multiple perspectives, and exhibit skepticism about information.

AB Understanding environmental problems is quite important simply because our knowledge, values and skills are determine to what extend we can solve our environmental problems [1]. With this in mind, pre-service teachers' attitudes toward environmental problems were studied in this study. In this context, another aim of the study was to investigate whether pre-service teachers' attitudes toward environmental problems differ in terms of some variables such as gender and department. In the study "Attitudes towards Some Environmental Problems Questionnaire," developed by Al-Rabaani and Al-Mekhlafi [2] was used after adapting the instrument to the Turkish. The questionnaire consists of 48 items under 5 dimensions which are energy problems, water problems, air pollution problems, waste problems and desertification problems. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was .84, suggesting high reliability. According to the results of the study, no statistically significant difference was found in the total attitude scores between pre-service biology and elementary science teachers and there was statistically significant difference in the total attitude scores between genders in favor of females.

AB Recently one of the aims of science education is to develop students' views of nature of science to achieve this, firstly, the teachers, educating the student, is expected to have realistic nature of science. In this study it is aimed to determine the views of NOS (nature of science) of the pre service science teachers according to grade level and gender. In addition, pre service science teachers, have receiving education at education faculty, if their views of NOS have changed or not through given training will be investigated. The sample consisted of 230 students of different grade level, enrolled in the department of science teacher training in Education faculty of Bayburt in 2008-2009 academic year. Data was collected using 'Science- Techonology- Society Questionnaire scale. The data collected was statistically analyzed whether there is significant difference in the pre service teachers' views of NOS according to grade level. Result showed that the pre service teachers' views on the NOS have highly positive and changes as parallel to increase in their grade level. At the same time, it was found that the pre service science teachers' views on the NOS have been generally scientifically acceptable (positivist) views.

AB Effective management of information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services is becoming increasingly important due to the growing complexity of their context. These services are often delivered by employees who work at widely dispersed locations and interact with each other to constitute knowledge-intensive service delivery networks (KISDNs). This paper contributes to the effective design and management of KISDNs by presenting a mixed-integer programming model that integrates disparate streams of research. This model facilitates analysis and managerial benchmarking of KISDN performance. It captures how the performance of such networks depends on the interaction between workflow decisions, structure of information flow networks (IFNs), and knowledge management decisions. We propose that knowledge about IFNs and worker competence can be effectively used to make workflow decisions. Our results, based on the study of different IFN archetypes, illustrate practices for effective management of KISDNs. Managers can enhance business value by recognizing existing IFNs, increasing randomness in IFNs, nurturing weak or performative ties depending on the archetype, assigning tasks based on effective worker competence, and selectively delaying assignment of tasks to workers. In addition, our results illustrate the impact of training and network density on KISDN performance.

AB Studies of Internet market have found that consumers' purchasing behaviors including information search, channel selection, and brand evaluation processes are impacted by the product/service types. In this research, we perform a comprehensive review of existing online product classification methods. An in-depth analysis of the rationale behind each method was studied, and important product characteristics were determined for integrating different approaches. Grounded on the theory of the components of perceived risk in product purchase and the recently emerged service science, the integrated classification will help companies to better understand the online consumer purchasing behavior and to design their e-commerce strategies accordingly. Survey results indicate that the integrated classification is an effective way to classify products and services marketed on the Internet. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Developing scientifically literate students who understand the socially contextualized nature of science and technology is a national focus of science education reform. Science educators' perceptions of risks and benefits of new technologies (such as biotechnology) may shape their instructional approaches. This study examined the perceived risk of biotechnology of four groups of science educators: pre-service science teachers, in-service science teachers, biology graduate teaching assistants, and biology professors (n = 91). Data sources included a survey instrument and card sort task designed to determine the respondents' structure of risk perception and factors contributing to this structure. The perceptions of the four educator groups were compared and contrasted along these dimensions. Results showed that the teacher groups were similar along many aspects of risk perception, but university professors were more likely to view the more subtle "gray areas" between biotechnology risks. The results are discussed in the context of understanding teacher risk perception on science pedagogical practice as well as the role of content knowledge and teaching experience on risk perception formation.

AB In today's information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled service economy, there is great interest in digital service management. While the extant technology acceptance research has mainly studied user acceptance of various ICTs, there is a dearth of research on consumer acceptance of personal ICT services. In this paper, we extend the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to the context of ICT services by examining the moderating role of ICT service type. We tested the proposed model in a large-scale survey of 4777 consumers, including both potential and current consumers of mobile data services (MDS), of two different types of MDS: communication and infotainment services. The results strongly supported the model with service type moderating key relationships. The findings have theoretical and practical implications for digital service management in particular and service science in general.

AB In the era of experience economy, service providers have to provide customers with high quality service experience in order to attract more customers and achieve higher customer satisfaction. Managing customer expectation is a critical approach for service providers to consider. Although customer expectation has been discussed across different research disciplines, to our knowledge, there is still no systematical and feasible way to apply customer expectation management into real environments. This study attempts to establish an intelligent service dispatching mechanism by using particle swarm optimization for customer expectation management. This mechanism can help service providers design and deliver satisfactory service experience to customers. In order to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism, this study employs micro- and macro-simulation experiments to confer and analyze its performance. The simulation results show service providers can gain benefit and raise customer satisfaction by managing customer expectation during service experience delivery. Meanwhile, customers can also receive memorable experiences and have positive responses to service providers and other customers. Consequently, a high performance ecosystem within service providers and customers can be formed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hallmark of service-value co-creation-is not easy to achieve in B2B IT service engagements. Typically, client and provider are both complicated organizational entities with multiple agendas and diverse stakeholders, and engagements often extend over years. We analyzed a number of IT service engagements to better understand their complex dynamics, with the ultimate goal of improving their outcomes. This paper reports on our study of how value co-creation unfolds over time, and identifies basic dynamics central to the modeling of service systems-actualization of service and realization of value-that are reflected in the proposed framework.

ID PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper presents findings from an exploratory study into a science teacher education initiative that seeks to build the foundations on which novice teachers can begin developing their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). The initiative involved the use of Content Representations (CoRes), which were originally developed as part of a strategy for exploring and gaining insights into the PCK of expert science teachers. As the student teachers explored existing CoRes the course lecturer saw potential for more effectively developing their PCK through engaging them in constructing their own CoRes for new topics. When given the opportunity, student teachers found the task challenging and their lack of classroom experience and experimentation proved to be a limiting factor. However, the contribution such a task could make to their future PCK development remained a distinct possibility in the lecturer's view. In the following year she carefully scaffolded the learning prior to CoRe construction such that the student teachers could more readily access relevant knowledge when attempting such a task. Their resultant CoRes and comments indicate that with appropriate and timely scaffolding the process of CoRe construction does have the potential for PCK development for novice teachers.

AB This research presents a multiple case study investigating the personal frameworks of pre-service science teachers as they experience a science in society course. Through examining the metaphors employed by the participants' student experiences were illuminated. These experiences revealed shifts in frameworks over time that were more consistent with the nature of science in many ways. In addition, resilient metaphors also emerged based on ideas students had regarding science and religion. The shifts in metaphors reveal the benefits of the science in society course for shaping views about the nature of science, while the resilient metaphors highlight the need for more focus beyond the one science in society course, so that the pre-service science teachers continue to grow professionally.

AB This study focussed on secondary school (11-18 years) pre-service teachers' (n = 73) knowledge of and attitudes towards risks associated with alpha, beta, and gamma radiations. A multi-method approach was used with physics, chemistry, biology, and history graduates undertaking the one-year initial teacher training, Post Graduate Certificate in Education course at a university in central England. A novel research tool, involving interviews about real concrete contexts and first-hand data collection with radioactive sources, was employed to gain insights into a sub-set of the sample (n = 12) of pre-service teachers' subject knowledge of and attitudes towards risk. The subject knowledge of all the pre-service teachers was also measured using a Certainty of Response Index instrument; multiple-choice questions with associated confidence indicators. Although the physicists displayed the higher levels of knowledge, they also demonstrated limitations in their knowledge and held misconceptions such as irradiation being confused with contamination. Physics graduates hold more rational attitudes and a greater willingness to accept risk while the attitudes of graduates in the other subject disciplines are more disparate. These findings raise questions about the extent to which pre-service science and history teachers have the knowledge necessary to teach this topic. The article concludes with discussion of the implications these findings have for initial teacher training, continuing professional development needs for teachers already in the profession, and curriculum developers.

AB We have investigated the effects of a teaching intervention based on evidence from educational theories and research data, on students' ideas in chemical kinetics. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the outcomes for the intervention. The subjects of the study were 83 university first-year students, who were in two different classes in a 4-year pre-service science teacher-training programme in Turkey. During teaching, an 'evidence-informed instruction' was applied in the experimental group whereas 'traditional instruction' was followed in the control group. Students' understandings of chemical kinetics were elicited through a series of written tasks and individual interviews. The results showed that while there was no significant difference in students' understandings in chemical kinetics in the two groups on the pre-test, in the post-test the students in the experimental group achieved significantly higher learning gains in chemical kinetics than did the students in the control group. Moreover, in response to teaching, students in the experimental group were more likely to use their knowledge consistently across different contexts (average 63.1%) than students in the control group (average 19%). The significance of these findings for further research, and for policy and practice relating to science teaching, are discussed.

AB Service science research seeks to improve the productivity and quality of service offerings by creating new innovations, facilitating business management, and applying practical applications. Recent trends seek to apply and extend principles from product family design and mass customization into new service development. Product family design is a cost-effective way to achieve mass customization by allowing highly differentiated products to be developed from a common platform while targeting individual products to distinct market segments. This article extends concepts from module-based product families to create a method for service design. The objective in this research is to develop a method for designing customized families of services using game theory to model situations involving dynamic market environments. A module-based service model is proposed to facilitate customized service design and represent the relationships between functions and processes in a service. A module selection problem for platform design is considered as a strategic module-sharing problem under a collaboration situation. A coalitional game is used to model potential module sharing and determine which modules used in the platform provide the most benefit. A case study involving a family of banking services is used to demonstrate implementation of the proposed method.

AB Despite a few international comparisons of the evolutionary beliefs of the general public, comparatively less research has focused on science teachers. Cross-cultural studies offer profitable opportunities for exploring the interactions among knowledge and belief variables in regard to evolution in different socio-cultural contexts. We investigated the evolutionary worldviews of pre-service science teachers from Asia (specifically South Korea), a region often excluded from international comparisons. We compared Korean and American science teachers': (1) understandings of evolution and the nature of science, and (2) acceptance of evolution in order to elucidate how knowledge and belief relationships are manifested in different cultural contexts. We found that Korean science teachers exhibited 'moderate' evolutionary acceptance levels comparable to or lower than American science teacher samples. Gender was significantly related to Korean teachers' evolution content knowledge and acceptance of evolution, with female Christian biology teachers displaying the lowest values on all measures. Korean science teachers' understandings of nature of science were significantly related to their acceptance and understanding of evolution; this relationship appears to transcend cultural boundaries. Our new data on Korean teachers, combined with studies from more than 20 other nations, expose the global nature of science teacher ambivalence or antipathy toward evolutionary knowledge.

AB Beliefs are psychological constructs potentially driving a teacher to make pedagogical decisions and act. In this study, the metaphor construction task (MCT) was utilised to uncover beliefs about teaching and learning science held by 110 pre-service science teachers participating in the standard-based teacher preparation programme. Overall, the participants' dominant metaphor categories were teacher as nurturer/cultivator, as knowledge provider, and as superior authoritative figure. The findings from descriptive comparisons did not show meaningful patterns of metaphors in association with the factors of gender, study major, or class level. The MCT, incorporated with in-depth interviews, revealed that out of 30 volunteers, more than half expressed a major change of metaphor after one semester's participation in the standard-based programme. The major path of metaphor change was from the teacher as nurturer/cultivator to the teacher as knowledge provider. Pre-service teachers' beliefs are metaphorically rooted and culturally influenced. The implications regarding the utilisation of MCT, modification of teacher beliefs, and science teacher education are also discussed.

AB Around 150 pre-service science teachers (PSTs) participated in a study comparing academic and personal characteristics with their misconceptions about basic chemical ideas taught to 11-16-year-olds, such as particle theory, change of state, conservation of mass, chemical bonding, mole calculations, and combustion reactions. Data, collected by questionnaire, indicate that despite all PSTs being regarded technically as 'academically well-qualified' for science teaching, biology and physics specialists have more extensive misconceptions than chemists. Two personal characteristics, PSTs' preferences for teaching as a subject 'specialist' or as a 'generalist' teaching all sciences and their self-confidence for working in these two domains, were assessed by responses to Likert-scale statements. Proportionately more biologists tend to be 'super-confident' generalists, while more physicists were specialists anxious about outside specialism teaching. No statistically significant relationships between personal characteristics and misconceptions were found, suggesting that chemistry may be being taught by confident PSTs with poor understandings of basic ideas. Furthermore, these data suggest that attending to PSTs' personal characteristics alongside other components of a teacher's professional knowledge base may contribute to creating more effective science teachers. The paper presents a novel way of considering PSTs' qualities for teaching that offers potential for further research and initial teacher training course development.

   education program
AB Preservice teachers begin their careers with their attitudes and perceptions about the profession. The purpose of this study is to identify how a four-semester teacher education program helps pre-service teachers' perceptions about constructivist teaching and learning to change as they progress through the program. The participants of the study included a total of 194 science preservice teachers in four different semesters of their teacher preparation program. The instrument used in this study was the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES). One way ANOVA was used to identify patterns within cohorts regarding preservice teachers' beliefs about constructivist strategies. Major findings indicated that although there were statistically different subscales of Shared Control and Critical Voice, in general preservice science teachers hold teacher centered beliefs. Based on these findings, it is possible to say that traditional teacher centered education have been carried on under the name of constructivism in Turkish teaching education programs.

AB Purpose - Recent discussions of the service-dominant logic (S-D logic) and the creation of a multidisciplinary service science highlight the need for a paradigmatic discussion that provides directions for ongoing service research. This article aims to examine different epistemological foundations and proposes a framework to describe and better understand the development and future of service research.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using the proposed framework, an assessment of 60 selected award-winning and most cited articles is categorized using the paradigmatic framework.
   Findings - Four paradigms are found to be prominent in service research: positivistic, hermeneutic, dialogic, and monologic. The positivistic option has been the dominant paradigm employed by service scholars, suggesting service scholars need to apply the three alternative paradigms more as a means to enrich and extend the service research discipline.
   Research limitations/implications - There is a need to discuss the fundamental beliefs and worldviews (ontological and epistemological positions) guiding service research. Paradigms are critical determinants and drivers of good research.
   Originality/value - A new framework for analyzing paradigmatic foundations in service research and directions for the future design of service research studies is proposed. The suggested framework could inspire scholars to reflect on their ontological and epistemological foundations and provide paradigmatic guidance within service research. This provides a basis for continuous expansion of the service research field.

AB Parking industries are so vital that no one functions if these industries do not function efficiently. Though this industry is undergoing a revolution, applying new technologies such as Service Science Management and Engineering (SSME) to achieve better performance and customer satisfaction, in Malaysia this industry is lagging behind. Against this concern, this study was undertaken with the purpose to unfold and understand the need for a more efficient parking management system to be implemented. The focus of this research is on integrating important components of business, management and technologies, in order to provide quality services for customers and thereby improve the management of parking systems. In a nutshell, the primary goal of this study is to improve the car parking service systems and this is carried out through service innovation which is inherently multidisciplinary. It further examines the many benefits of advanced parking management systems. This study used a quantitative approach and a questionnaire survey was used. The evaluation findings derived through a second survey showed beyond doubt that the proposed system has excellent advantages over the existing manual system.

AB Many studies related to the use of interactive whiteboards (IWBs) in educational settings have shown that IWB technology can result in enhanced presentations and in the development of student motivation and student performance. However, the relationship between the use of IWBs and Technological Pedagogical Content and Knowledge (TPACK) by teachers is yet to be fully investigated and understood. The purpose of this study was to integrate IWB technology and peer coaching to develop the TPACK of secondary science teachers in real classrooms. An IWB-based peer coaching model was developed. Participants of this study included four in-service science teachers. The sources of data included written assignments, reflective journals and interviews. The results displayed three major findings. First, science teachers used IWBs as instructional tools to share their subject-matter knowledge and to express students' understanding. Second, the IWBs helped the science teachers who encountered teaching difficulties in the traditional classroom better implement their representational repertoires and instructional strategies. Finally, the proposed model of integrating IWBs and peer coaching can develop the TPACK of science teachers. The research implications of this study are provided along with suggestions.

AB This special theme aims to analyze the linkage between service-orientation and electronic markets. On the one hand, questions focus on how service-oriented thinking and service-oriented solutions provide value to electronic markets, and on the other how electronic markets improve the effectiveness of service industries, such as healthcare, telecommunications, logistics, education, and others. While the papers in the special theme section highlight selected aspects of a services-based business transformation, this preface discusses main underlying assumptions of the service evolution, underpins the link between service-orientation and electronic markets, and concludes with some developments on the emerging trans-disciplinary field of service science.

AB The concept of service Science, Management, and Engineering (SSME) is an emerging interdisciplinary approach that combines fundamental management, and engineering theories. The objective is to help organizations improve their competiveness in a rapidly changing business environment by exploring the true requirements of their customers, and setting up an effective service process with the support of IT. Despite the significance of SSME, few studies have attempted to develop a methodology to guide and implement SSME research. To address this research gap, we discuss the interdisciplinary nature of the SSME approach. We review related literature and theories, and explore the tools used in various fields relevant to SSME. Then, we propose a systematic three-phase framework for SSME research. Our interdisciplinary review and the proposed framework are designed to help researchers and practitioners utilize available SSME tools and theories. We believe the framework will enable researchers and practitioners to implement their respective SSME processes more effectively and efficiently.

AB New science teachers should be equipped with the ability to integrate and design the curriculum and technology for innovative teaching. How to integrate technology into pre-service science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge is the important issue. This study examined the impact on a transformative model of integrating technology and peer coaching for developing technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) of pre-service science teachers. A transformative model and an online system were designed to restructure science teacher education courses. Participants of this study included an instructor and 12 pre-service teachers. The main sources of data included written assignments, online data, reflective journals, videotapes and interviews. This study expanded four views, namely, the comprehensive, imitative, transformative and integrative views to explore the impact of TPACK. The model could help pre-service teachers develop technological pedagogical methods and strategies of integrating subject-matter knowledge into science lessons, and further enhanced their TPACK.

ID ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; FOREST
AB In 1992, the Forest Service adopted a new operating policy, Ecosystem Management, which minimized the agency's timber production goals in favor of a more ecologically balanced view of its responsibilities. In explaining this shift, scholars have dismissed the possibility of internal reform, arguing that the Service could not change without irresistible external pressure from environmental activists and new public values supporting biodiversity. Viewing the Service's shift through the lens of the spotted owl controversy, however, demonstrates the important role agency culture played in instigating bureaucratic change. The Service's evolution stemmed from the rising influence of its scientists in policy formation. Their research in support of protecting the owl and the biodiversity of old-growth forests thrived in an agency that nurtured scientific independence, and it thrust them into leadership positions. Forest Service science legitimized the arguments of environmentalists and crystallized public values favoring biodiversity into a new policy.

AB When managing their growing service portfolio, many manufacturers in B2B markets face two significant problems: They fail to communicate the value of their service offerings and they lack the capability to generate profits with value-added services. To tackle these two issues, we have built and evaluated a collaborative filtering recommender system which (a) makes individualized recommendations of potentially interesting value-added services when customers express interest in a particular physical product and also (b) leverages estimations of a customer's willingness to pay to allow for a dynamic pricing of those services and the incorporation of profitability considerations into the recommendation process. The recommender system is based on an adapted conjoint analysis method combined with a stepwise componential segmentation algorithm to collect individualized preference and willingness-to-pay data. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, our system requires significantly less customer input before making a recommendation, does not suffer from the usual sparseness of data and cold-start problems of collaborative filtering systems, and, as is shown in an empirical evaluation with a sample of 428 customers in the machine tool market, does not diminish the predictive accuracy of the recommendations offered.

AB Understanding how changes in ecosystem properties feedback into land-use decisions remains relatively uncharted territory for land science in general and for ecosystem service science in particular. In Europe, debates on rural development can be framed in terms of opposing socio-political discourses. These include formulations of desirable, acceptable and unacceptable changes that contribute to changing the planning- and policy-based drivers of land-use decisions. We explored the relationships between such discourses and local descriptions of a mountain grassland area in the central French Alps documented using semi-structured interviews. We found that descriptions focused on either the (1) productive functions of the local grasslands, (2) the aesthetic qualities of the surrounding landscape or (3) its cultural heritage value (testimony to past land-use patterns and practices). We interpreted these descriptions as social representations and found that they were unequally represented in existing socio-political discourses identified at the European level, thus illustrating some strong political barriers between local perceptions of landscape changes and the policy drivers of those changes.

AB There is a growing market for services and an increasing dominance of services in economies worldwide. From an economic perspective, services grow steadily more important and will be increasingly offered and deployed via the Internet. A good example is a community-based e-service that represents the provision of e-service to a community of individuals or business partners. This paper presents a method that can identify the promising and valuable new service features for innovating a given community e-service. Based on a service ontology and the combination of semantic social network and perception science, the method has three steps. First, through the semantic social network, identify the customer segments based on the same need. Second, to sustain the service attraction to the customers of a customer segment, manipulate the service choice set based on the attraction effect defined in perception science. Third, for service innovation and transformation, identify the new necessary enhanced service components based on a social-network-based analysis of the emergence behavior of customers on the e-service platform. The preliminary evaluation results also justify our claimed contributions for community-based e-services. i.e., a systematic method to manage customer segmentation well, sustain the service attraction, and identify new services required through a combination of semantic social network, perception science, and social network analysis.

AB This study explores how third-party assurance seals, a privacy service provided by vendors to mitigate customers' fears, has an impact on on-line customer satisfaction and repeat-purchase intention. It asks the following research questions: Do assurance seals influence on-line service experience? If so, how do they affect consumers' satisfaction and repeat-purchase intention? The study shows, first, that seals provide a frame such that a consumer's overall satisfaction and repeat-purchase intention would be higher when vendors provide assurance seals than when they do not. Second, applying the concept of diminishing sensitivity, it shows that consumers would be subjectively less sensitive to service performance of vendors who provide seals than vendors who do not provide seals. The hypotheses are tested on data obtained from Bizrate.com. The empirical analysis supports the hypotheses.

AB Retailing firms operating in a hypercompetitive environment are increasingly leveraging a hybrid commerce strategy to reach their customers through both physical and virtual channels. This study seeks to better understand the aspects of physical and virtual retail channels that can be integrated to create value for consumers. The role of consumers in co-creating value is examined in a hybrid commerce service-delivery system. The study draws on the theoretical foundations of value co-production as well as the customer contact model to develop a set of hybrid process metrics. A structural model is then advanced to examine the relationships between these processes and consumer value. Survey data from 300 consumers assessing hybrid commerce stores were used to empirically test this value co-creation model. Results demonstrate that the integration of promotion information, product and pricing information, and transaction information enhances information quality, while the integration of information access, order fulfillment, and customer service increases service convenience. Overall, the metrics developed and the structural model results offer a better understanding of the design of an effective value-creating hybrid commerce service-delivery system.

AB The collection of personal information from customers is a necessity for Internet merchants, who need such information to effectively provide service to customers. The ease with which data can be acquired and disseminated across the Web, and the peculiarities of the electronic environment have led to growing concerns from many potential customers over disclosing personal information to e-service providers. Self-disclosure theories suggest that consumers' willingness to disclose personal information is based on their assessments of the related costs, risks, and benefits. This study experimentally manipulated initial trust and the nature of the incentive given to encourage information disclosure. It also measured actual disclosure behavior rather than just intention or attitude. A key finding is that subjects did not claim to be more willing to provide information in the presence of incentives, but in fact, as indicated by their behavior, were more inclined to do so. What is more, privacy concern, involvement with the service category considered, and attitude toward on-line shopping act like antecedents for a willingness to share attitudinal measure but are not diagnostic of actual behavior.

AB The increasing importance of information technology (IT) services in the global economy prompts researchers in the field of information systems (IS) to give special attention to the foundations of managerial and technical knowledge in this emerging arena of knowledge. Already we have seen the computer science discipline embrace the challenges of finding new directions in design science toward making services-oriented computing approaches more effective, setting the stage for the development of a new science service science, management, and engineering (SSME). This paper addresses the issues from the point of view of service science as a fundamental area for IS research. We propose a robust framework for evaluating the research on service science, and the likely outcomes and new directions that we expect to see in the coming decade. We emphasize the multiple roles of producers and consumers of services-oriented technology innovations, as well as value-adding seller intermediaries and systems integrators, and standards organizations, user groups, and regulators as monitors. The analysis is cast in multidisciplinary terms, including computer science and IS, economics and finance, marketing, and operations and supply chain management. Evaluating the accomplishments and opportunities for research related to the SSME perspective through a robust framework enables in-depth assessment in the present, as well as an ongoing evaluation of new knowledge in this area, and the advancement of the related management practice capabilities to improve IT services in organizations.

AB We examine contract choices in the provision of "software-as-a-service" (SaaS), which is a business innovation that transforms information technology (IT) resources into a continuously provided service. We draw upon agency theory and modularity theory to propose that one of the central challenges in service disaggregation is that of knowledge interdependencies across client and provider organizations. The resulting lack of verifiability of certain tasks results in a multitask agency problem. Our key research questions involve (1) the suitability of high- versus low-powered incentives in SaaS contracts when the outsourced tasks involve business analytics that are difficult to verify, and (2) how such contract choices are affected by the modularity of interfaces between the client and the provider. Analysis of data collected from 154 providers of SaaS offering a range of IT services supports our contention that when contracting for business analytics characterized by knowledge interdependencies across clients and providers, incentives should be "low powered." Modularity in the interfaces of the service provider increases the desirability of high-powered incentives in such situations. Our results are robust after accounting for endogeneity issues arising from unobserved matching between service providers and the nature of IT services outsourced by clients. With the increasing importance of information systems in services, this paper suggests that arm's-length relationships and high-powered incentives may be ineffective in incentivizing providers to perform on complex business analytic tasks, unless accompanied by the modularization of interfaces.

AB The computing industry is gradually evolving to cater to the demand for software-as-a-service (SaaS). Two core competencies that have emerged over the past few years are that of the application service providers (ASPs) and the application infrastructure providers (AIPs). The arrangements between them result in system dynamics that is typical in supply chain networks. We examine the performance of an SaaS set up under different coordination strategies between these two players. Our analysis indicates that coordination between the monopoly ASP and the AIP can result in an outcome with the same overall surplus as can be achieved by a central planner. Even though the players have an incentive to deviate, it is possible to create the right incentives so that the economically efficient outcome is also the Nash equilibrium. The results of the analysis have significant implications for the coordination strategies for providers in the burgeoning business model of delivering software services over the Internet.

AB Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is one of the most discussed topics in the information systems (IS) discipline. While most computer scientists agree that the service-oriented paradigm has clear benefits in terms of technical quality attributes, it has been difficult to justify SOA economically. The few studies that have investigated the strategic and economic aspects of SOA are mostly exploratory and lack a more comprehensive framework for understanding the sources of its economic potential. Based on IS and SOA literature, our work goes further in suggesting the SOA economic potential model, which describes the causal relationships between the SOA's style characteristics and value it can provide on the business side. Using this model, we investigate 164 SOA cases published between 2003 and 2008 to explore the economic rationale for adopting SOA. Our findings suggest that SOA's business benefits are currently mainly driven by operational and information technology infrastructural improvements. However, enterprises also realize strategic benefits from SOA; for example, by electronically integrating with their business partners by means of SOA. We use the results of our study to derive propositions and suggest a research model for future studies on SOA's economic potential.

AB An important task for managers in information technology (IT) service settings is the judgment of service performance. The complex and intangible nature of IT services, however, renders this task especially difficult. We use a sample of 85 outsourced software development projects to test for the presence of the "input bias," which is defined as the systematic misuse of nondiagnostic input information in forming managerial judgments of outcomes. The service outcome we examine is process performance. The diagnostic inputs are given by objective performance metrics based on the final cost and duration of completed projects, whereas the nondiagnostic inputs are risk anticipations formed by managers prior to the start of the project. We find strong evidence of the input bias, which leads managers' subjective assessments to diverge considerably from objective outcomes, and that it is moderated by contract type. Our study contributes to better service management by improving our understanding of managers' judgments of service performance and how these judgments are formed.

AB With the move to an information-based economy, financial services has become a key contributor to the U.S. gross domestic product. Even as consolidation reduces the number of banks, small banks with under $100 million in assets continue to report higher profit margins than large banks with over $100 million in assets. Lacking scale, small banks employ a service-oriented business strategy (customer intimacy), whereas large banks focus on productivity and throughput (operational excellence). Information technology (IT) plays a key role in applying each strategy, but as banks move toward customer intimacy in general, the challenge is to grow without undermining service quality. Using a balanced panel data set from 43 U.S. banks, this paper finds that banking strategies are becoming more customer focused. Yet for large banks in particular, IT remains resolutely operations focused. This misalignment could restrict future banking performance. In this way, this paper contributes to the service science literature by using size to dissect banking strategies and performance.

AB Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been promoted as a technology that can enhance information systems agility, interoperability between applications, deployment flexibility, and reusability. As with any new information technology (IT), the decision to adopt SOA cannot be taken lightly, given the nontrivial investment in economic and personnel resources. The complexity associated with industry-wide diffusion, coupled with organization, industry, and environment factors, contributes to a lack of a clear strategy for assessing the business value that SOA provides an organization. This research attempts to shed light on this process of value creation for an organization, using a system dynamics approach. A detailed model of the industry diffusion coupled with organization adoption is presented. After suitable calibration and validation, a series of simulations using the model evaluate the efficacy of SOA under a variety of diverse conditions. The results of the simulations indicate clear benefits of SOA over monolithic ITs when employed under appropriate conditions. Situations where SOA fails to live up to expectations are also identified. The model and accompanying simulations can serve as a practical decision support tool for an organization to help make the strategic decisions of adopting and implementing SOA.

AB The emergence of new service science approaches to business problems in information technology (IT) services offers new, unusually relevant insights for the senior management of vendors in this business area. This research examines how service-level agreement contract flexibility should be designed when the technological and business market environments result in volatility of demand, based on an understanding of related changes in the cost drivers that underlie IT services contracts. Our approach draws on a blend of well-known methods from financial economics the real option pricing method and the contingent claims analysis method. In particular, our research examines a setting in which a vendor provides IT services to a client according to a prenegotiated IT services contract in the presence of demand volatility. We analyze the motivation of and value consequences for a vendor that offers the client the flexibility to opt out of the contract. For example, the client might switch to another vendor, or backsource and provide its own services internally. Our core results offer important foundational thinking for how to specify various forms of IT service-related flexibility in terms of put and call options from the point of view of an IT services vendor, so that their value and exercise timing can be estimated. We show that the client firm's demand trigger value for deciding when to backsource its IT services varies, and it depends on the degree of demand volatility as well as the usage-based fees charged by the vendor. Working from our modeling approach, we also are able to characterize the extent to which a vendor can benefit from bearing the costs of making a backsourcing flexibility option available to its client.

AB In this study, the author implemented a problem-based learning (PBL) experience that allowed students in an advanced science methodology course to explore differentiated instruction. Through working systematically in small, collaborative groups, students explored the nature of differentiated instruction. The objective of the study was to examine pre-service teachers' developing conceptions of differentiated instruction (DI) as a way to teach for diversity. The author adopted action research as a strategy to explore students' perceptions of DI in the context of science teaching and learning. Several data collection methods and sources were adopted in the study, including student-generated products, student interviews, classroom observation, and journal writing. Outcomes report on students' perceptions of both the potential and challenges associated with adopting a DI approach to science teaching and learning.

TI Moving Forward and Making a Difference: Research Priorities for the
   Science of Service
SO JOURNAL OF SERVICE RESEARCH

DE research priorities; service science; technology; innovation; cocreation
AB Given the significant, sustained growth in services experienced worldwide, Arizona State University's Center for Services Leadership embarked on an 18-month effort to identify and articulate a set of global, interdisciplinary research priorities focused on the science of service. Diverse participation from academics in a variety of disciplines working in institutions around the world-in collaboration with business executives who lead organizations ranging from small startups to Global 1000 companies-formed the basis for development of the priorities. The process led to the identification of the following 10 overarching research priorities:
   Fostering service infusion and growth
   Improving well-being through transformative service
   Creating and maintaining a service culture
   Stimulating service innovation
   Enhancing service design
   Optimizing service networks and value chains
   Effectively branding and selling services
   Enhancing the service experience through cocreation
   Measuring and optimizing the value of service
   Leveraging technology to advance service
   For each priority, several important and more specific topic areas for service research emerged from the process. The intent is that the priorities will spur service research by shedding light on the areas of greatest value and potential return to academia, business, and government. Through academic, business, and government collaboration, we can enhance our understanding of service and create new knowledge to help tackle the most important opportunities and challenges we face today.

AB In chemical kinetics, in addition to the concepts related to kinetics, stoichiometry, chemical equilibrium and the characteristics of the reactants are often involved when comparing the rates of different reactions, making such comparisons very challenging for students at all levels, as well as for pre- service science teachers. Consequently, four multiple-choice items were developed to determine the understanding of 217 pre- service science teachers of the kinetics of acid reactions that are taught at the Grade 9 to 10 levels in Singapore schools. Each of four items compared two different acid reactions under similar conditions, and respondents were required to select the best graphical representation for the two reactions. Respondents were also required to provide reasons to explain their particular selection for each item. In addition, one item on the dissociation of sulfuric acid and two items involving excess/limiting reagents were also included to provide additional data on the pre- service teachers' understanding of these concepts that were assessed in the four items on kinetics of acid reactions. The results showed that the pre- service teachers had difficulties in explaining the properties of different common acids, including the dissociation of the acids and how these affect the rates of the different acid reactions. This study highlights the importance of determining pre- service teachers' understanding of the concepts that they will be teaching with a view to addressing areas of difficulty, as these will have consequences on their future students' learning.

AB This paper raises awareness of industry's move to blend ITSM lifecycle concepts with the systems development lifecycle to foster collaboration between the silos of systems development and IT operations. Academia has an important role in integrating ITSM into traditional systems development coursework. The case of systems development is used to illustrate the types of IT service management concepts and models that can be introduced into current systems development offerings to support the focus on IT services being called for by industry today.

AB In recent years, the movement to establish a concept of service science has consolidated itself as a new academic discipline (NESSI, 2007; IBM Academic Initiative, 2007; Spohrer, Maglio, Bailey, Gruhl, 2007). Service science is taking a growing interest in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), a framework which promises to develop a flexible and a robust IT-based service capable of responding efficiently to business demands. However, the development of SOA remains at a nascent stage and many early adopting firms find it difficult to establish effective strategies for adopting the framework, especially since they cannot be sure of its successful implementation. The current paper takes the form of an exploratory study based on a review of 34 SOA literatures and 22 interviews and claims to identify twenty factors in successful SOA adoption; the paper subsequently defines a concrete implementation policy for each factor. Comparative analysis, drawing on interviews with vendors and users, demonstrates both similarities and differences in the perspectives presented by a range of research literatures, proceeding to suggest complementary methods of SOA adoption that take account of both vendors' and users' needs. Thus far, research on SOA implementation has not offered a detailed account of the critical success factors (CSFs) conducive to successful SOA adoption. This work thus fills a gap in more closely reflecting the reality of putting SOA into practice.

TI Longing for service: Bringing the UCL Conception towards services
   research
SO INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE UCL Conception; Service; Services; Frameworks; Cross-disciplinary
ID IN-SERVICE; DESIGN; SYSTEMS; WORK; DISCIPLINE; FRAMEWORK
AB There has been an increase in the relevance of and interest in services and services research. There is a acknowledgement that the emerging field of services science will need to draw on multiple disciplines and practices. There is a growing body of work from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers and practitioners that consider services, but there has been limited interaction between service researchers and HCI. We argue that HCI can provide two major elements of interest to service science: (1) the user centred mindset and techniques; and (2) concepts and frameworks applicable to understanding the nature of services. This second option is of major concern in this paper, where we consider Long's work (undertaken with John Dowell) on a Conception for HCI. The conception stands as an important antecedent to our own work on a framework that: (a) relates the various strands of servicer research; and (b) can be used to provide high-level integrative models of service systems. Core concepts of the UCL Conception such as domain, task, and structures and behaviours partially help to relate systematically different streams of services research, and provide richer descriptions of them. However, if the UCL Conception is moved towards services additional issues and challenges arise. For example, the kinds of domain changes that are made in services differ; services exist in a wider environment; and that effectiveness judgements are dependent on values. We explore these issues and provide reflections on the status of HCI and Service Science. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

FX The writing of this paper has been supported by the EPSRC/BAE systems
   funded S4T (Solution Service Support: Strategy and Transformation)
   programme. The three reviewers provided great stimulus to clarify the
   concepts within this paper. I hope I have not put them off considering
   services themselves. Attendees at the CIRP IPS2 conference and the 1st
   and 2nd HCI and Services workshops at HCI 2008 and 2009 have provided
   much useful discussion and insight, alongside colleagues within the
   Institute for Manufacturing and Engineering Design Centre at Cambridge.
   The usual caveats about misunderstandings apply to this work.

AB Reform-minded practices are widely encouraged during pre-service science teacher education in concert with national reform documents. This contrasts to the nature of instruction within university science laboratories in which pre-service teachers enrol, which are largely confirmatory in nature. Undergraduate science laboratories are taught predominantly by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) with minimal teacher preparation. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to investigate the instructional practices and teacher beliefs of eight GTAs at a university with very high research activity who completed a reform-minded Teacher Certificate Programme, asking: What are their beliefs about teaching? How are their practices described? Do their beliefs and practices differ from one another? Do their teaching beliefs correspond with their practices? Findings indicate that GTAs held moderately reform-minded "transitional" beliefs of teaching following the programme, yet displayed fairly traditional instruction. Cross-case findings highlight similar patterns across subscales of the RTOP that draw attention to underlying constraints of the laboratory curriculum structure. We suggest that GTA professional development is best undertaken concurrent with laboratory course revision.

AB Teachers are searching for new venues through which they may meet stringent professional development requirements. Under competitive funding from NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Office of Education and the NASA Explorer Schools Project, U. S. Satellite Laboratory, Inc. created a series of live, online, interactive short-courses. In this case study, a mixed methods analysis of a variety of data sources reveals that diverse educators from a variety of classroom contexts view the short-courses as a useful professional development tool, both as a vehicle for a teacher's own professional growth and for classroom applications. Teachers were particularly interested in the ability to participate in a collaborative community of practice with other educators, instructors, and scientists from across the country, and they found the flexible design of the professional development to be useful. This short-course design offers promise for future professional development opportunities.

AB The design and delivery of IT services is increasingly a global endeavor. Organizations of all types are engaging in global activities enabled by IT services. To meet the needs of global stakeholders and remain competitive in global markets, it is important for the IT services that support global business processes to consistently provide value that meets or exceeds customer expectations. However, little guidance is found in the academic or practitioner literature regarding how to create IT service value in a global context. Drawing from the organization science and service science literature domains, and using an analytical conceptual research methodology, this research develops a Global IT Service Value Creation (GITSVC) Framework and Process Model to address this gap in the literature. The GITSVC Framework and Process Model are tools that can be used to guide practice and future research. Implications and recommendations for theory and practice are discussed.

TI Typology of Service Innovation from Service-Dominant Logic Perspective

AB This study provides a conceptual framework with respect to service innovation, especially from a service-dominant logic (S-D logic) perspective. Even though innovation has been discussed as one of the most critical elements in enhancing the competitiveness of service industry, it was not clear how service innovation should be different from diverse types of existing innovation. The S-D logic provides a novel and valuable theoretical perspective that unifies the conventional literature on innovation. According to this new logic, four types of service innovation are presented based on two dimensions: the degree of co-creation and the degree of networked collaboration. We argue that service innovation can arise by the activity of value co-creation between firm and customer on the first dimension. On the second dimension, the firm needs to enhance their own capabilities for service innovation by applying the resources of all actors including suppliers and customers. Our framework indicates that it is critical for productive service innovation to make customers participate in value creation process and to integrate the dispersed resources held by participants. Examples are discussed with respect to different types of services innovation.

AB Companies in collaborative networks require intermediation to perform. The collaborative network forms the breeding environment for the configuration of a Virtual Enterprise that can handle a business request. This configuration task can be supported by IT services. For collaborative networks such as production networks focused on non-digital services and products we propose to assign specific intermediation tasks to a human network moderator supported by these IT services. The obvious support is targeted for the configuration of the Virtual Enterprise i.e. the search and selection from the available products, services, and competences found among the network participants. The configuration decision can jeopardize the network performance by harming the trust necessary to build new Virtual Enterprises. Through a further intermediation task trust can be inspired and promoted in the network. This article shows how the configuration is supported by a Decision Support Service and how a Transparency Support Service supports the downloading and acceptance of decisions in collaborative networks. The article outlines the IT supportive service system and exemplifies the use by a scenario example. Results on intermediation in collaborative networks can prove helpful for general service science problems.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contribution of Asian researchers towards the literature on service science. In achieving this aim, a review of papers published in five top service research journals is carried out.
   Design/methodology/approach Papers from the following five service research journals are reviewed: International Journal of Service Industry, Management, Journal of Services Marketing, Journal of Service Research, Managing Service Quality, and Service Industries Journal. The review considers all papers published in the journals over a 14-year period from 1995 to 2008. The abstract and main body of the papers are analyzed for content.
   Findings This paper identifies the core contribution of researchers from Asian countries. The top five Asian countries identified are Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel, and South Korea. Also identified are patterns and emphases in service research across different countries.
   Research limitations/implications This paper focuses on five top service research journals over a 14-year period. Patterns of research emphasis in over 280 publications are analyzed. Further studies can include other journals and/or conferences in service science.
   Practical implications Scholars can benefit from insights into the contribution by Asian researchers in services. Specifically, the paper notes the particular emphases of research from different Asian countries while acknowledging the reach and richness of their contributions.
   Originality/value The main value of this paper is its uniqueness in discussing the contribution of researchers specific to Asian countries in top service journals. This paper provides valuable insights into the nature of academic publishing of Asian researchers in this burgeoning area.

AB Teaching Science in English is one of the most important changes made in the education policy in Malaysia recently. In order to understand the impact this language policy has on prospective teachers, this study was conducted to find out bow pre-service teachers of science cope with the challenges of teaching through the medium of the English language during their teaching practicum. 154 trainees enrolled in the Bachelor of Education in Science program at a local university participated in this study. Data is drawn from survey questionnaires with the student teachers so as to examine the instructional strategies used to cope with language related problems while teaching Science. Based on the results of this study, the researchers discussed implications for professional development in teacher training programs.

AB We introduce this special issue by addressing seven key challenges associated with managing hybrid human-automated service systems. These consist of the following:
   1. What strategic and tactical issues arise when managing hybrid service systems?
   2. How should the core "value proposition" be set?
   3. What special considerations arise in the design and implementation phases?
   4. How can service delivery be managed to identify systemic problems and to address service breakdowns?
   5. How can communications with clients improve the functioning of set-vice systems?
   6 What performance measures should be used to monitor process, outputs, client perceptions, and financial outcomes?
   7. How can we coordinate the various interdisciplinary activities needed to address the previous six issues?
   We consider these challenges after first characterizing the historical evolution of service delivery, reviewing some of the literature in the administrative sciences, and proposing a conceptual framework. Copyright (C) 2009 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   co-creation; Service-dominant logic
AB Two outcome-based defence contracts are studied in the attempt to better understand the provision of services in maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) environment that is contracted on the outcome of the equipment, rather than the provision of equipment. The nature of the contract changes the dynamics of the delivery, bringing complex issues such as customer behaviours and involvement to the forefront, with both customer and firm focused on value co-creation and co-production, rather than each party's contractual obligation. We uncover four areas that are crucial in the understanding of value co-production in service delivery and analysed them through a systems approach combined with the application of the service-dominant logic, both considered as the theoretical underpinnings of service science.

   MICROSCOPIC LEVEL IN CHEMISTRY
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE chemistry teaching; guided imagery; imagination; mental images;
   particulate level of matter; science education
AB This study explores the mental images at the microscopic level of matter created by 22 preservice science teachers in Oman. Participants were encouraged during a guided imagery session to construct mental images for a scenario written about the explanation of the reaction of sodium in water. They were then asked to describe what they envisioned in their own imagination. Participants had images that were based on textbook illustrations, modeling kits, a solar-system model, physical properties, and humanized animations. 3D mental images represented 33.36% of participants' mental images at the microscopic level, while images in 2D format formed 39.15% of the overall created mental images. Several factors shaped the participants' mental images, such as their imaginative ability, attention mode, and the nature of their old images stored in their long-term memory. Most of the participants experienced image transformation from one form to another as they were progressing in the GI session. This unstable reliance on different models might indicate unorganized conceptual networks in learners' LTM: a feature that characterizes novices' mental networking. On the contrary, past research has revealed that experts have more organized and sophisticated conceptual networking. This study argued that participants lacked the homogeneous and reliable mental model of the atom that is required to carry out advanced cognitive processes for mental exploration of chemical phenomena. The absence of this mental model might explain the overwhelming finding in literature that many learners fail to explain and predict chemical phenomena.

AB The purpose of this study is to explain prospective science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about the cell. Lesson preparation, laboratory plan, interview with teacher candidates, and concept mapping were used to collect the data for prospective teacher's PCK. The study was conducted with six prospective science and technology teachers in the spring of 2006-2007 in Pamukkale University-Turkey. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a topic on cell, describing the PCK in terms of relations between four different aspects: Knowledge about science and technology curriculum, belief about subject matter knowledge, knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment of students. According to the result of the study, pre-service teacher's knowledge inaccurate special teaching methods, they used a teacher-centered approach, and also they have a high belief of subject matter knowledge. Based on the result of this study, which were discussed in the light of national and international literature, we have suggestions for further researchers, curriculum developers, and science and technological teacher educators.

AB A curriculum to train teacher candidates is a very important factor in developing teacher candidates' conceptual understanding of scientific concepts. Teacher candidates have a dramatic impact on students' ability to understand and construct new knowledge of the concepts. The purpose of this study was to determine the preconceptions and misconceptions of teacher candidates about basic astronomy concepts. This was measured by administrating the validated diagnostic questions from the latest version of the Astronomy Diagnostic Test 2.0 - 113 teacher candidates in the School of Education in Amasya University, Turkey. The findings indicated that teacher candidates held a series of misconceptions on several basic astronomy concepts. Common misconceptions were identified and a constructivist-inquiry approach to teaching basic astronomy concepts in the astronomy curriculum for pre-service teachers was proposed.

AB This article presents the findings of an international collaborative investigation into preservice teachers' views on the nature of scientific knowledge development with respect to six elements: observations and inferences, tentativeness, scientific theories and laws, social and cultural embeddedness, creativity and imagination, and scientific methods. A total of 640 preservice teachers, 209 from the United States, 212 from China, and 219 from Turkey, participated in the study. The survey "Student Understanding of Science and Scientific Inquiry (SUSSI)", having a blend of Likert-type items and related open-ended questions, was used to gain a fuller understanding of the preservice teachers' views of the nature of scientific knowledge development. Across the three countries, the participants demonstrated better understanding of the tentative NOS aspect but less understanding of the nature of and relationship between scientific theories and scientific laws. The Chinese sample scored highest on five of the six Likert sub-scales, the USA sample demonstrated more informed views on observation and inference, and the Turkish preservice teachers possessed relatively more traditional views in all six NOS aspects. Conclusions and limitations of the present study as well as implications and recommendations for future studies, are also discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate Turkish pre-service science and mathematics teachers' computer self-efficacies (CSEs) and computer attitude (CA) considering gender, year in program, and computer ownership as independent variables. Additionally the study aimed to examine the relationship between CSE and CA. Computer Self-efficacy Scale (CSES) and Computer Attitude Scale (CAS) were administered to 605 freshmen and senior teacher candidates. Descriptive results indicated that overall pre-service teachers had relatively high scores on both scales. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that a participant's gender was not a significant factor on his/her CSE and CA scores except for the computer liking sub-scale of the CAS. Seniors had higher scores than freshmen in the CSES and in the confidence dimension of the CAS. Those participants who owned computers had significantly higher scores on the CSES and CAS as compared to those who did not own a computer. A significant three-way interaction was found among the three independent variables, namely gender, major of study and computer ownership. Finally, correlational analysis showed that participants' CSES scores related to sub-scale scores of the CAS at varying degrees. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The service system is the basic abstraction of service science
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Service science; Service-dominant logic; Service system
AB bstraction is a powerful thing. During the nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as mass, energy, work, and power. During the twentieth century, the information revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as binary digit or bit, binary coding, and algorithmic complexity. Here, we propose an abstraction for the twenty-first century, in which there is an emerging revolution in thinking about business and economics based on a service-dominant logic. The worldview of service-dominant logic stands in sharp contrast to the worldview of the goods-dominant logic of the past, as it holds service-the application of competences for benefit of others-rather than goods to be the fundamental basis of economic exchange. Within this new worldview, we suggest the basic abstraction is the service system, a configuration of people, technologies, and other resources that interact with other service systems to create mutual value. Many systems can be viewed as service systems, including families, cities, and companies, among many others. In this paper, we show how the service-system abstraction can be used to understand how value is co-created, in the process laying the foundation for an integrated science of service.

TI A service accountability framework for QoS service management and

LA English
DT Article
DE Service-oriented architecture; Accountability; Quality of service;
   Diagnosis; LLAMA service bus
AB Service science, management and engineering (SSME) research is to study the methodology and technology for service innovation, design, development and delivery. Since service industry is very quality-sensitive and trust-dependent, we propose a service accountability management framework to detect, diagnose, defuse and disclose the root cause for any problematic service process. The accountability support is important for SSME since service processes often rely on external service providers to deliver part of the service functionalities. A service system must have effective yet efficient mechanisms to ensure that every external service is delivering a consistent and acceptable level of performance to meet the end-to-end quality of service (QoS) of the whole service process. In this paper, we present the accountability framework, identify the components in an accountable service architecture, and design an accountability diagnosis methodology. We also briefly present the inteLLigent Accountability Management Architecture (LLAMA) project which implements the accountability service bus (ASB), an agent-based middleware to support the monitoring, diagnosis, and reconfiguration of e-services. LLAMA ASB interacts with accountability agents to monitor services and the Accountability Authority to automatically diagnose faulty situations. The LLAMA technology is useful to ensure the QoS in SSME-based systems.

AB Healthcare is indeed a complex service system, one requiring the technobiology approach of systems engineering to underpin its development as an integrated and adaptive system. In general, healthcare services are carried out with knowledge-intensive agents or components which work together as providers and consumers to create or co-produce value. Indeed, the engineering design of a healthcare system must recognize the fact that it is actually a complex integration of human-centered activities that is increasingly dependent on information technology and knowledge. Like any service system, healthcare can be considered to be a combination or recombination of three essential components - people (characterized by behaviors, values, knowledge, etc.), processes (characterized by collaboration, customization, etc.) and products (characterized by software, hardware, infrastructures, etc.). Thus, a healthcare system is an integrated and adaptive set of people, processes and products. It is, in essence, a system of systems which objectives are to enhance its efficiency (leading to greater interdependency) and effectiveness (leading to improved health). Integration occurs over the physical, temporal, organizational and functional dimensions, while adaptation occurs over the monitoring, feedback, cybernetic and learning dimensions. In sum, such service systems as healthcare are indeed complex, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the human-centered aspects of these systems. Moreover, the system complexities can only be dealt with methods that enhance system integration and adaptation.

AB In this paper we discuss the foundations and process of design of a research-informed instructional unit aimed for pre-service science teacher education. The unit covers some key ideas on the nature of science (around methodology, theory change, scientific inference and explanation, values, gender issues) anchoring them in a well-known episode from the history of science-the 'discovery' of radium by the Curies. Such episode is mainly examined as reconstructed in the 1997 French commercial film 'Les Palmes de Monsieur Schutz'. Pre-service science teachers are required to solve three tasks, individually and in small groups; those tasks are respectively centred around: (1) the distinction between 'discovering' and 'inventing'; (2) scientific modelling via abduction; and (3) the extended hagiographic treatment of the figure of Madame Curie. Plenary debates around the tasks aim at acquainting pre-service science teachers with some powerful concepts of twentieth century philosophy of science.

AB An understanding of the nature of service architecture and modularity is crucial to service design and innovation. Two sets of approaches are developed that further our understanding and support decision making. First is a systematic decomposition approach to architecture modeling that allows organizations to understand their current architecture, evaluate alternative architectures, and identify key interfaces between different parts of the service. Second, the article develops a service modularity function (SMF), a mathematical model indicating the degree of modularity deriving from unique services and the degree to which the modules can be replicated across a variety of services. Three areas are identified that can contribute to competitiveness: the possession of unique service modules or elements not easily copied in the short term by competitors; the ability to exploit these through replication across multiple services and/or multiple sites; and the presence of a degree of modularity, which in turn supports both customization and rapid new product development. The SMF can support decision making in the design of services and the exploitation of service innovation. In particular, the relationship between architecture and modularity and the roles of service contact personnel in the customization of services is shown to be complementary. It is proposed that service customization can be either combinatorial (the combination of a set of service processes and products to create a unique service) or menu driven (the selection of one or more services from a set of existing services/products to meet customer needs).

AB The widespread usage of technology for service provision to customers has created a new and challenging environment for the design of interactive systems, with the emergence of technology enabled multi-channel services. Requirements engineers involved in the design of such service systems must actively work together with interaction designers and service managers to better integrate customer service experience and technology components, requiring unifying methods and tools within the emerging field of service science management and engineering. This paper proposes the service experience blueprint (SEB), a multidisciplinary method for the design of technology enabled multi-channel service systems and illustrates its application in two examples of redesign of banking services that involved an extensive study with more than 4,000 bank customers. The SEB method is based on concepts and tools from RE and interaction design, such as goal-oriented analysis and conceptual modeling, but also uses methods developed in the service and marketing fields, such as service blueprinting. SEB brings marketing research methods to the requirements process, as they can provide a useful contribution for the elicitation of customer experience requirements in service environments. By bringing together goal-oriented modeling and use case modeling from requirements engineering, with service blueprinting from service design, the SEB method contributes to creating a shared understanding and a unifying language to better support the design of new technology enabled multi-channel service systems, where technology and service issues are deeply intertwined.

AB A series of interviews and classroom observations were conducted with a group of in-service science teachers, students, school principal, and computer lab supervisors, from a "Discovery'' female school in Jordan to assess their utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) in teaching science. The study also intended to determine how these participants were using ICT and if they had any internal and external impediments in the way of the effective integration of ICT in the teaching of science. Results showed that some participants were using ICT creatively in their science teaching. However, despite considerable political pressure to increase ICT use in the classroom, most expressed frustration at the lack of ICT tools, support from the school, from the Ministry of Education, and from the surrounding community. The article proposes possible resolutions to help these participants overcome their impediments. Some of the suggested resolutions for the internal impediments include involving teachers in preparing the school's timetable, equipping the school with more ICT tools and offering more training courses for teachers. However, the suggested resolutions for the external impediments involve (1) The Ministry of Education to rethink the administration of board examinations, (2) The school to sacrifice scoring higher in board examinations for preparing more creative and more versatile students' perspectives.

AB Strategic reasoning about business models is an integral part of service design. In fast moving markets, businesses must be able to recognize and respond strategically to disruptive change. They have to answer questions such as: what are the threats and opportunities in emerging technologies and innovations? How should they target customer groups? Who are their real competitors? How will competitive battles take shape? In this paper we define a strategic modeling framework to help understand and analyze the goals, intentions, roles, and the rationale behind the strategic actions in a business environment. This understanding is necessary in order to improve existing or design new services. The key component of the framework is a strategic business model ontology for representing and analyzing business models and strategies, using the i* agent and goal oriented methodology as a basis. The ontology introduces a strategy layer which reasons about alternative strategies that are realized in the operational layer. The framework is evaluated using a retroactive example of disruptive technology in the telecommunication services sector from the literature.

DE Teacher education; Genetics; Ecology; Nature of Science
ID CONCEPTIONS; PRESERVICE; VIEWS
AB Research has shown that practising and pre-service science teachers often hold naive and uninformed views of the nature of science (NOS). In this study we examined the discipline-specific nature of pre-service teachers' views of the NOS. We report on the conceptions of ecology research held by university students as compared to a discipline often-considered distinct, genetics, and to scientific inquiry at large. Through questionnaires and interviews, we surveyed the perceptions of inquiry in science, ecology, and genetics among 37 undergraduate students who are enrolled in a pre-service biological science teacher certification programme. While pre-service teaching students acknowledged that both ecology and genetic domains were scientific, they appear to hold an image of scientific inquiry that is more closely aligned with genetics than with ecology inquiry. Additionally, these students tended to hold a anthropocentric view of the purpose of science and listed more human benefits to genetics. These distinct images may impact instructional practices related to the teaching of NOS.

AB This research focuses on use of a triadic teaching approach in a science-technology-society (STS) course designed for future science teachers for middle schools in Turkey. Forty-three pre-service science teachers were enrolled in a semester-long course organized around issues students identified and used throughout the semester. The triadic teaching approach includes library-online searches that lead the students to design and conduct investigations, to carrying out mini-scientific symposia, and to preparing and conducting poster presentations open to the entire student body and faculty. The results of a 30-item Likert scale, administered to the students as a pretest and a posttest, indicated that there were significant increases in positive attitudes towards STS issues from the beginning to the end of the study. Individual interviews were also conducted with the students to determine the individual effects of each component of the triadic teaching approach on their attitudes towards STS issues. All aspects of the new approach provided significant contributions to the development of more positive attitudes among the students towards STS via interviews and on all sub-scales of a survey administered that include: (1) pupil interest in STS issues; (2) teacher interest in STS issues; (3) general perceptions regarding importance of STS issues.

AB This study implemented an online peer assessment activity to help 52 Taiwanese in-service science and mathematics teachers to develop research proposals in an educational research course. The participants were divided into 16 groups, and each group was required to submit a proposal via three rounds of online peer-assessment activity. This study found that, through the online peer-assessment activity, the in-service teachers could enhance their proposals at the initial stage of the activity, but there was almost no substantial improvement at the later stage. In addition, the amount of feedback they obtained was positively related to the performance from the first round to the second round; however, few significant relationships were found from the second to the third round. This study also showed that the process of peer assessment could be used to clarify assessment criteria and that sufficient support from the instructor can maintain participants' attitudes towards this activity, which were relatively optimistic throughout.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the Turkish pre-service science teachers' level of knowledge about air pollution. The participants' levels of knowledge about "Air Pollution" were identified via a closed form questionnaire. The measuring instrument is applied on 325 female and 137 male students inside of the sample and a total of 462 students was applied this test. The questionnaire using in this study consisted of 17 statements. The results of the study revealed that, even though Turkish pre-service science teachers' level of knowledge about air pollution were well shaped, it is shown that most of these pre-service science teachers have misconception. The results show that they did not hove adequate knowledge (level) about some basic air pollutants and their effects. The results also revealed that pre-service teachers have misconceptions about whether the pollutants CFCs, CO2 and Hydrocarbons are pollutants or not. In order to prevent that, pre-service teachers should be informed about the effects and activities of these pollutants and what should be done.

AB In this paper, the effects of university experiences in improving the misconceptions of pre-service science teachers about motion (displacement, distance, average velocity and speed) they brought from secondary education were investigated. This descriptive study was conducted in Ahi Evran University, Faculty of Education between 2003-2007 academic years. Total 52 students studying in science education department took part in the study. In the data collection, 12 open-ended questions were asked to pre-service science teachers both in the 1st and 4th years. Frequency tables and percentages were used for analyzing and presenting the data. The paper concludes by arguing that university process could not remove the misconceptions of pre-service science teachers regarding the definitions and quantities of displacement, distance, average velocity, speed, and operational questions.

ID SERVICE-DOMINANT LOGIC; BUSINESS MARKETING TEXTBOOKS
AB Purpose - With B2B (business-to-business) and new developments in marketing as the springboard, this paper seeks to emphasize complexity and context in marketing systems, embracing both 13213 and B2C (business-to-consumer) marketing.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a conceptual analysis of new developments in marketing through network theory and case study research. Findings - Recent theory points to a network and systems approach to marketing and to changing roles between suppliers and customers. Both many-to-many marketing as a broadening of relational approaches and the service dominant (S-D) logic stress consumer involvement, exposing the customer's interactive role. The IBM service science programme enrols research and education in developing more functional service systems. The conventional divide in goods and services marketing is dissolved in favour of supplier-customer interaction.
   Research limitations/implications - B2B and B2C are both part of complex contexts. Case study research and network theory allow complexity and context to come forward. Network theory should be applied in all marketing, and concepts in marketing need to be constantly evaluated as to validity and relevance. The conventional sectors (manufacturing, services, agriculture) are supplier-centric whereas marketing prescribes customer centricity. By focusing on continuous theory generation better theory will replace previous theory.
   Practical implications - Marketers overview the complexity of specific marketing situations, to systematically observe relational phenomena and the customer's role, and will be better able to foresee opportunities and avoid mistakes in marketing planning and execution.
   Originality/value - The paper offers a network view which is little represented in research and education. With growing dependency on larger integrated systems such a coherent view becomes increasingly more urgent. In a new marketing logic of service and value creation, the reductionism, fragmentation and linearity of Western science are challenged in favour of a comprehensive network approach. B2B and B2C are treated as perspectives of a grander marketing context and not as independent categories, and the broadened role of customers in value networks is recognized. Goods and services can only be understood and handled in a unified context.

AB Purpose - This study aims to propose a tree-based analytic tool that may be used in analyzing a large-scale and complex service process. The tenet of this tool is based on the Boolean logic and named service tree analysis (STA). The proposed STA aims to reflect the customer participation perspective and to propose how to analyze the service process and deduce useful information.
   Design/methodology/approach - Fault tree analysis is used as an underlying methodology since it has a Boolean logic to describe the customer's selection of each element and identifies critical events. Taking these advantages of the fault tree, the proposed STA consists of three main parts; service tree construction, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis. First, a service tree is constructed depending on how the service elements are selected by the customer; If the subordinate events are always selected by customers, they are linked with an AND gate, otherwise, with an OR gate. Next, in the qualitative analysis, service elements are characterized as core services, supporting services, and optional services by deducing a minimal service cut set. Last, qualitative analysis deals with deriving the impact of each service element based on the Kano model.
   Findings - The suggested STA has advantages which help strategic operation and management of the service process.
   Originality/value - This study is unique and even exploratory in that it first adopts the notion of tree analysis in structuring a large-scale, complex service system. Further, the proposed service tree provides a systematic approach from customer participation perspective, which makes the service process to be managed efficiently.

AB Service-oriented technologies and management have gained attention in the past few years, promising a way to create the basis for agility so that companies can deliver new, more flexible business processes that harness the value of the services approach from a customer's perspective. Service-oriented approaches are used for developing software applications and software-as-a-service that can be sourced as virtual hardware resources, including on-demand and utility computing. The driving forces come from the software engineering community and the e-business community. Service-oriented architecture promotes the loose coupling of software components so that interoperability across programming languages and platforms, and dynamic choreography of business processes can be achieved. Nevertheless, one of today's most pervasive and perplexing challenges for senior managers deals with how and when to make a commitment to the new practices. The purpose of this article is to shed light on multiple issues associated with service-oriented technologies and management by examining several interrelated questions: why is it appropriate now to study the related business problems from the point of view of services research? What new conceptual frameworks and theoretical perspectives are appropriate for studying service-oriented technologies and management? What value will a service science and business process modeling offer to the firms that adopt them? And, how can these approaches be implemented so as to address the major challenges that organizations face with technology, information and strategy? We contribute new knowledge in this area by tying the economics and information technology strategy perspectives to the semantic and design science perspectives for a broader audience. Usually the more technical perspective is offered on a standalone basis, and confined to the systems space - even when the discussion is about business processes. This article also offers insights on these issues from the multiple perspectives of industry and academic thought leaders. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB Manufactured products and manufacturing processes have benefited hugely from the application of scientific methods to their development and production. In contrast, service development is often treated as a black art, outside the scope of a scientific approach.
   Services now account for more than 75 per cent of both employment and GDP in developed economies. Services differ in a number of ways from manufactured goods. In particular, services are intangible, they often need to be adapted to meet individual needs (so there is a strong element of end-user involvement in their delivery) and they are consumed in real-time; a service is indistinguishable from the service delivery system. Yet most management theory and business models are based on manufacturing.
   A growing number of companies and universities across the world are interested in developing a science of services and service systems. It is expected that the development of a more scientific approach to service development and delivery will result in new and better services, increased service quality and reduced costs. Because the subject is at an early stage basic issues such as what should be its core concerns are still under debate
   This paper is an introduction to services and systems science. The aim is to discuss why a science of service systems is needed, outline its potential benefits and to contribute to the ongoing debate on the content and nature of this new field of study.

AB This paper is a first exploration of the relationship between service science and Grid computing. Service science is the study of value co-creation interactions among entities, known as service systems. Within the emerging service science community, service is often defined as the application of competences (resources) for the benefit of another. Grid computing is the study of resource sharing among entities, known as virtual organizations, which solve complex business, societal, scientific, and engineering problems. Within the Grid computing community, service is sometimes defined as protocols plus behavior. Both Grid computing and service science are connecting academic, industry, government, and volunteer sector collaborators on a range of projects including eScience, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and more. This paper compares and contrasts the notions of resource, entity, service, interaction, and success criteria for the two areas of study. In conclusion, new areas for collaborative inquiry are proposed.

ID CONTRACT DESIGN
AB A significant portion of the services industry is focused on providing services (medical, legal, financial, personal, and travel) to individuals. However, studies have shown that a less visible but rapidly growing segment of the service sector comprises firms that provide business functions to other businesses. The sector covers tasks such as payroll processing, procurement, and information systems management, as well as business consulting, technical support, call center operations, and software development. Firms may choose to purchase, rather than perform, these business functions to reduce costs, to mitigate risk, or simply to focus on their processes that provide marketplace differentiation. Transferring a business function from within a firm to an Outside supplier is often called "outsourcing"; when the supplier provides the service from a lower-cost country, it is called "offshoring." The risks and benefits of outsourcing to the firm purchasing a business service have been studied in some detail by both academics and consultants. In this paper, we outline revenue management issues faced by business service providers and describe some new opportunities for the use of analytic methods in the service science sector.

AB Information technology (IT) services providers are exposed to exogenous risks faced by the industry as a whole, and endogenous risks from their Current portfolio of IT contracts. This exposure may lead to cost overruns or legal responsibility for service-level breeches. Providers can leverage information about their risk positions implied by their IT services contract portfolios to gain strategic advantage over their competitors. We build theory in support of a new construct, profit-at-risk, for evaluating the trade-offs between contract profitability and service-level risk, stemming from financial economics theory and models. We simulate an IT services contract portfolio, and show how managers can reduce organizational risk by forgoing profit-maximizing contracts in lieu of more conservative service-level agreements, yet still achieve high returns. Our approach provides decision support for ex ante contract evaluation and negotiation, and a means to conduct ex post efficiency evaluation. It also aligns IT service management with best practices in financial management.

AB The current growth of the service sector in global economies is unparalleled in human history-by scale and speed of labor migration. Even large manufacturing firms are seeing dramatic shifts in percent revenue derived from services. The need for service innovations to fuel further economic growth and to raise the quality and productivity levels of services has never been greater. Services are moving to center stage in the global arena, especially knowledge-intensive business services aimed at business performance transformation. One challenge to systematic service innovation is the interdisciplinary nature of service, integrating technology, business, social, and client (demand) innovations. This paper describes the emergence of service science, a new interdisciplinary area of study that aims to address the challenge of becoming more systematic about innovating in service.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Service systems are value-co-creation configurations of people, technology, value propositions connecting internal and external service systems, and shared information (e.g., language, laws, measures, and methods). Service science is the study of service systems, aiming to create a basis for systematic service innovation. Service science combines organization and human understanding with business and technological understanding to categorize and explain the many types of service systems that exist as well as how service systems interact and evolve to co-create value. The goal is to apply scientific understanding to advance our ability to design, improve, and scale service systems. To make progress, we think service dominant logic provides just the right perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory of service systems, their configurations, and their modes of interaction. Simply put, service-dominant logic may be the philosophical foundation of service science, and the service system may be its basic theoretical construct.

AB The purpose of this study is to determine pre-service science teachers' misconceptions, knowledge level and the ways of gaining knowledge in relation to ozone layer and ozone layer depletion, which is one of the global environmental problems. In order to get relevant data, the questionnaire comprising 30 items on a five point Likert type scale and seven multiple choice questions were administered to 308 pre-service science teachers. Statistical procedures were performed in order to interpret the data obtained through the questionnaires. The findings revealed that the pre-service science teachers participated in the study have insufficient knowledge as well misconceptions regarding ozone layer depletion. In addition, it was also found out that they had the information about the ozone layer not only through formal education but also through other sources such as media, peers etc. The differences and similarities of the results compared to the other research studies are emphasized and implications of the results for deeper understanding as well as for better teaching are discussed.

TI Toward a conceptual foundation for service science: Contributions from
   service-dominant logic
SO IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Advancing service science requires a service-centered conceptual foundation. Toward this goal, we suggest that an emerging logic of value creation and exchange called service-dominant logic is a more robust framework for service science than the traditional goods-dominant logic. The primary tenets of service-dominant logic are: (1) the conceptualization of service as a process, rather than a unit of output; (2) a focus on dynamic resources, such as knowledge and skills, rather than static resources, such as natural resources; and (3) an understanding of value as a collaborative process between providers and customers, rather than what producers create and subsequently deliver to customers. These tenets are explored and a foundational lexicon for service science is suggested.

SO IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL

ID BUSINESS
AB This paper relates our experiences at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), designing a service science discipline. We wanted to design a discipline of service science in a principled and theoretically motivated way. We began our work by asking, "What questions would a service science have to answer?" and from that we developed a new framework for understanding service science. This framework can be visualized as a matrix whose rows are stages in a service life cycle and whose columns are disciplines that can provide answers to the questions that span the life cycle. This matrix systematically organizes the issues and challenges of service science and enables us to compare our model of a service science discipline with other definitions and curricula. This analysis identified gaps, overlaps, and opportunities that shaped the design of our curriculum and in particular a new survey course that serves as the cornerstone of service science education at UC Berkeley.

TI Service science: Catalyst for change in business school curricula
SO IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID DISCIPLINE
AB For a service delivery system to produce optimal solutions to service-related business problems, it must be based on an approach that involves many of the traditional functional areas in an organization. Unfortunately, most business school curricula mirror the older traditional organizational structure that dominated businesses throughout most of the twentieth century. This structure typically consisted of vertically organized functions (or silos), such as production, marketing, and finance, with each silo operating largely independently of the others. Similarly, business schools today are usually organized by functional departments-such as marketing, finance, accounting, and operations management-with little interaction among them. Within this traditional silo-structured environment, it is very difficult to properly develop a curriculum, or even a course, in service management. Consequently, a significant gap exists between the education received by business school graduates and the skills that they need to succeed in today's service-intense environment. This paper explores the underlying causes of this gap and suggests ways in which the emerging field of service science can facilitate the changes in business school curricula that will make them more relevant in meeting the needs of today's businesses and organizations.

SO IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Service industries comprise roughly 75 percent of the gross domestic product of developed nations. To design and operate service systems for today and tomorrow, a new type of engineer must be educated, one who focuses on services rather than manufacturing. Such an engineer must be able to integrate three sciences-management, social, and engineering science-in the analysis of service systems. Within the context of the Center for Engineering Systems Fundamentals, a research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we discuss how newly emerging service systems require such a three-way integrated analysis. We deliberately select some nonstandard services, because many business services, such as supply chains, have been studied extensively.

AB There are several essential legal topics that must be included in the research agenda of service science. in this paper, we discuss these topics, beginning with an analysis of the definition of a service and a categorization of some of the actors in service systems, with their diverse interests. A set of case studies and scenarios is presented to illustrate the kinds of legal challenges that are involved in providing user-centric and customer-oriented services. We conclude by suggesting the most important legal topics that should be studied further in relation to service science.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper presents an overview of the science and art of discrete choice modeling for service sector applications. With the ongoing momentum of service science, management, and engineering, the discrete choice modeling approach provides a sophisticated tool kit for assessing the needs and preferences of service customers. We provide directions for designing and executing discrete choice studies for services and discuss several examples for a number of industries including health care, financial services, retail, hospitality, and online services. We conclude with a discussion of the many managerial implications of the discrete choice approach.

ID BELIEFS
AB While the development of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is considered to be a goal of teacher education, teaching about the concept itself is an unusual practice. In this case study, we explore the outcomes when a teacher educator explicitly introduces student-teachers to ideas about PCK through the use of a CoRes and PaP-eRs conceptualisation. The case study explores how, through this purposeful use of PCK in a pre-service science teacher programme, student-teachers' thinking about their teaching and about their development as science teachers is shaped.

AB Purpose - The paper aims to fill a gap in the literature in relation to the determinants of customer value within the research and development (R&D) industry and word-of-mouth. it investigates whether context specific variables, such as organizational type and contract length, change customer value evaluations and the value - intention to repurchase - recommend system.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey of Australian customers of a research and development service organization was conducted. Structural equation modelling was used to develop a model investigating factors that affect customer value, intent to re-purchase, and word-of-mouth/recommendation.
   Findings - Relationship benefits, service benefits and sacrifice all had a significant influence on customer value. Efficient use of time is crucial for sacrifice evaluation. Relationship benefits were larger for government organizations than private organizations. importance of value to recommend the organization to others was higher for longer contracts and government customers.
   Research limitation/implications - Results show that R&D organizations need to concentrate on both the technical service/science aspects and the relationship aspects in their contracts. Government institutions tended to emphasize the relationship benefits while private businesses considered service benefits, relationship benefits and sacrifice nearly equal in their determination of value. intent to contract R&D organization for further work and the willingness to recommend it to others as a highly specialized and competent service provider seem to be higher for government customers and longer contracts.
   Originality/value - This paper investigates customer value in a little researched industry, R&D. The findings are relevant for similar professional business-to-business services.

AB This case study describes a teacher's development of and creativity in manipulating physical models in an astronomy course for in-service science teachers of K-8. Specifically, she organized a data table from several charts of numbers, constructed a moon-ball model in addition to a 2-D model, and created a hula hoop model as a concrete realization of her mental model. Examination of the transformation and construction processes revealed how she revised existing models and added new elements. These reconstruction experiences afforded her with a higher level of comprehension and self-awareness of her mental models. Three of the teacher's actions contributed to her increased understanding and deployment of the models: she enhanced her autonomy by changing the given models and solving problems she was interested in; she communicated with her partners and shared her knowledge by materializing her models; and she constructed new models on the basis of her experience. This case study shows that the transformation process, especially a cascade of small steps with the emergence of a more dramatic departure, is a key to generating scientific knowledge.

AB The advancement of web services in the last few years has spurred a number of revolutionary concepts in information technology and management including service-oriented architectures, service-oriented computing, and services science, management and engineering, which can be collectively called as "services computing." Services computing is a new research field that goes beyond traditional computing disciplines as it includes not only architectural, programming, deployment, and other engineering issues, but also management issues such as business component modeling, business process design, and service delivery. In this paper, we provide an overview of emerging research concepts in services computing without attempting to unify them as it will take sometime for the field to become mature. In addition, we take a position that the ultimate goal of services computing is to create the necessary technological and managerial foundation to support enterprise agility. In this short paper, we give an overview of services computing, describe its relationship to enterprise agility, and discuss basic technical and managerial issues. Finally, we introduce the papers that are published in this special issue.

AB The international science education community recognises the role of pre-service science teachers' views about the interdependence of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) in achieving scientific literacy for all. To this end, pre-service science teachers' STS views signal the strengths and the weaknesses of science education reform movements. Turkey, a country that follows the international reform movement, aims at improving citizen's understanding of the STS interdependence to enable them to fully participate in an industrialised, democratic society. This study explores the Turkish pre-service science teachers' views (n = 176) on STS issues and discusses the ongoing reform efforts' strengths and weaknesses within the context of the study findings. Data were collected through an adopted "Views on Science - Technology - Society" instrument. Analysis revealed that many participants held realistic views on science, technology, and society interdependence, while their views on technology and the nature of science were differed. Some viewed technology as an application of science, and some viewed science as explanatory and an interpretation of nature. Most agreed that the scientific knowledge is tentative but they did not present a thorough understanding of the differences between hypotheses, laws, and theories.

AB As contact with liquids occurs from an early stage in individuals' lives, children construct explanations for liquids and liquid-state phenomena. These may differ from the accepted scientific explanations, interfere with formal teaching, and even persist until entry into higher education. The objective of this investigation is to compare student-teachers' and in-service science teachers' explanations for liquid-state phenomena, in three European countries. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire applied to 195 Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish in-service science teachers. Data analysis revealed poor performance among participants, showing low percentages of correct answers. In addition, no systematic differences were found between participants from the three countries, and teaching experience seems to minimize some of the conceptual difficulties showed by in-service teachers. Globally, science education seems to have had a limited effect on student-teachers' and in-service science teachers' conceptions. We conclude that more attention should be paid to the liquid state in both initial and continuing teacher education programs so that teachers can understand more clearly liquid-state phenomena and succeed in explaining them to their students.

Yet it's one of the least-studied areas of the economy. Some see economics, operations research, industrial engineering, or the science of complex systems as the appropriate starting point for a general services theory. Others contend that the pervasiveness of services creates a need for many specific disciplines. An interdisciplinary effort called Service Science, Management, and Engineering provides a solution that falls between those two approaches.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to evaluate the quality of service delivery process designs, based on how closely they meet process requirements of key stakeholders while taking variability into account.
   Design/methodology/approach - A Monte Carlo computer simulation of the flowchart of the service delivery process is used to capture the effects of multiple types of variabilities and parametric uncertainties on process variables of interest, and the Taguchi quality loss framework is applied to estimate overall process quality. As an example, a proposed modification to a patient-treatment process in a hospital emergency department is evaluated.
   Findings - This paper demonstrated a method that service managers can use to evaluate the quality of service delivery process designs.
   Practical implications - This method can evaluate modifications to various aspects of a service delivery process, and can assist managers to fail-safe the entire process. Furthermore, it characterises process quality using a range of probable values instead of a single value, such as the process mean, and thus provides a more realistic representation of quality.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to service engineering in two ways: by adapting the Taguchi quality loss approach, commonly used to assess manufacturing process quality, to a service delivery process; and by incorporating uncertainty, due to imprecise knowledge of process parameters, into the quality assessment.

DT Article
AB This self-study was designed to explore problem-based learning (PBL) as an instructional approach in the context of a pre-service science education methods course. Through the development and implementation of PBL curriculum, the author's goals were to improve her classroom practice and her understanding of that practice, to contribute to the knowledge base of teaching and learning, and to immerse students in authentic learning experiences that would encourage them to adopt an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. In studying her own practice, the author adopted classroom-based action research as a strategy to explore PBL. Data collection methods and sources included field notes, interviews, and student-generated documents. The author describes how many aspects of her pedagogical content knowledge (conceptions of the purposes for teaching subject matter, knowledge of students' understanding, curricular knowledge, and knowledge of instruction and assessment) and classroom practice were transformed.

AB Service Science is a new term for a new paradigm which aims at the solution of an obvious problem: How to make the increasing fusion of business and IT successful in a dynamically changing and risk adverse environment? This question has to be raised at different levels of abstraction, from macroeconomic viewpoints circulating around qualities of service societies to service oriented architectures of business applications. We worked in an interdisciplinary team consisting of industrial engineers and distributed system experts on the issue of business and IT alignment in a well-defined system, namely the shop-floor domain in discrete production industry. The result of this work is an ANSI/ISA 95 compliant model-driven methodology for manufacturing operations management. This methodology was evaluated by means of the realization of a SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) demo scenario for production operations management.

TI A networked peer assessment system based on a Vee heuristic
SO INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING INTERNATIONAL

ID WORLD-WIDE-WEB
AB This study implements a networked peer assessment system based on the use of a Vee heuristic. Using this system, students submit their homework (relating to designing science activities) via the underlying network facility. They then assess each other's homework by offering suggestions - again, through the network. Students then modify their original designs based on the suggestions that they receive. This procedure is repeated for two or three consecutive rounds. In this process, each student functions as an author, a reviewer, and an adapter. This learning model allows students to further develop their critical thinking skills. Preliminary peer assessment results revealed that the networked peer-assessment model and Vee heuristic facilitated pre-service science teachers to continuously progress when designing science activities.

TI Scepticism and gullibility: the superstitious and pseudo-scientific
   beliefs of secondary school students
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB A survey of the superstitious and pseudo-scientific beliefs of secondary school students (N = 2159) was undertaken, with some follow-up interviews. Gender differences were found at all ages with females generally less sceptical than males. An exception was a belief that aliens from another planet had visited the Earth, about which males were consistently less sceptical than females. The average level of scepticism increased steadily on going from Key Stage 3 students (11-13 years), through Key Stage 4 (14-16 years), to the sixth-form science students (17-18 years), with a further increase in scepticism in a sample of pre-service science teachers. Nevertheless many school students were very gullible and this should be of concern to science educators.

TI Crafting multicultural science education with preservice teachers
   through service-learning
SO JOURNAL OF CURRICULUM STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSTRUCTIVISM; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY
AB Many science educators, in the US and elsewhere, suppport the idea that all students should have fair and equal opportunities to become scientifically literate through authentic, real problem-based science education. However, this challenge requires teachers to rnd ways to help all students feel comfortable with, and connected to, science. Despite the general consensus around the ideal of science for all, science teacher education programmes have had little or no impact on preservice teachers' philosophies of teaching and learning, especially as it relates to serving underserved populations in science. In this paper, I explore community service-learning as one way of addressing the multicultural dimension of preservice education with the following three questions: In what ways does involving pre-service science teachers in community service-learning influence their views on multicultural science education, in theory and practice? What qualities of community service-learning make multicultural science education a realistic objective? How might service-learning be used to push our collective understanding of what an inclusive and liberatory multicultural science teaching practice could be? I explore these questions and propose further areas of research by using a case study involving service-learning from my own teaching-research with preservice students.

AB In an exploratory study of family support services in Massachusetts, three focus groups were convened to obtain the perspectives of parents caring for individuals with developmental disabilities and living at home. This article summarizes key themes that emerged from the group discussions: effects of family support on family life, flexibility of supports, barriers, unmet needs, and recommendations for change. Social workers ann health care professionals can enhance the well-being of people with developmental disabilities and their families by addressing the needs of the entire family, facilitating family choice and control of supports, and helping families navigate the complex service system.

AB This study investigated Emirates pre-service and in-service teachers' views about the nature of science. A questionnaire was developed and administered to 31 female pre-service science teachers, and 224 inservice chemistry teachers. The questionnaire covered five aspects of the nature of science identified by Palmquist and Finley (1997). These are: scientific theories and models; role of a scientist; scientific knowledge; scientific method; and scientific laws. The results indicated that Emirates teachers' views are neither clearly traditional nor clearly constructivist - they held mixed views about the nature of science. The study attributed the existence of the traditional views to historical reasons and the educational system. The presence of constructivist views was attributed to religious factors, where some of students' religious beliefs agree with some constructivist views. The study argued that the traditional view about the nature of science is in conflict with the teachers' religious beliefs. Teaching science in the Arab culture using the traditional view about science creates what Tobin (1996) called 'symbolic violence'. The study concluded that introducing science from the constructivist point of view and using what Jegede (1996) called 'collateral learning' would help to diminish such violence.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate teachers' declarative metacognitive knowledge of higher order thinking skills. This was a qualitative study conducted within the educational setting of in-service science teachers' courses. The main finding is that teachers' intuitive (i.e., pre-instructional) knowledge of metacognition of thinking skills is unsatisfactory for the purpose of teaching higher order thinking in science classrooms. A general practical implication of this study is that courses which prepare teachers for instruction of higher order thinking should address extensively the issue of metacognition of thinking skills.

ID EDUCATION; BOTSWANA
AB This study sought to measure secondary science teachers' level of commitment to traditional culture in Zimbabwe and how this orientation is related to their beliefs concerning science instructional ideology. The study involved 63 in-service science teachers studying for the bachelor of education degree at the University of Zimbabwe. The science teachers in this study maintain a fairly traditional posture with regard to aspects of traditional authority, religion, view of nature, and social change. They show a much stronger shift away from tradition with regard to sex roles, causality, and problem solving. Their scores of commitment to indigenous culture were positively and significantly correlated to traditional noninquiry ideology preference scores but not to inquiry instructional ideology preference scores. Implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB The question posed in this paper refers to the inspiration of those who founded systems thinking in the fifities.  It is a question that has been given new life in discussions of the foundations within the more recent schools of systems thinking of the eighties and nineties.  The first part of this paper investigates the relation between science and wisdom by analysing each more closely.  Against this background, the second part evaluates differing conceptions of systems thinking.  Emphasized is the service science can render to wisdom.  To this service, systems thinking can make a specific contribution.

DT Article
AB Simulaton is one of a range of techniques available to assist managerial decision-making. Frequently portrayed in service industry contexts simply as a means of solving problems, simulation can help managers achieve a variety of business objectives. A case study is presented that shows how simulation can be applied to the analysis of the behaviour of a complex service system. The value of simulation as a planning tool is highlighted especially for fine-tuning a system to ensure the productive use of resources and assure quality of service. The case study also notes the benefits that can be gained from using modern personal computer-based simulation software packages with facilities for animation.

AB Poor immigrant families must cope with stress stemming from loss of home and adaptation to the host country. Those with handicapped children are also burdened with a parallel set of stressors in adapting to the handicap in an alien environment that may include a complex service system. Implications for practice are discussed with particular emphasis on advocacy to enhance delivery of services.
