AB  - The question posed in this paper refers to the inspiration of those who founded systems thinking in the fifties. It is a question that has been given new life in discussions of the foundations within the more recent schools of systems thinking of the eighties and nineties. The first part of this paper investigates the relation between science and wisdom by analysing each more closely. Against this background, the second part evaluates differing conceptions of systems thinking. Emphasized is the service science can render to wisdom. To this service, systems thinking can make a specific contribution. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Researchers, educators and practitioners are showing interest in service systems, and in the potential of establishing the new academic discipline, services sciences, management and engineering (SSME). The service scientist might identify the stakeholders and interview them to learn of the boundaries of the service system and of any problems and opportunities that the stakeholders see. The scientist might create a formal model of the service system, including a table of all stakeholder interactions. They should also extrapolate the year-over-year evolution of the system and hour-by-hour activities of stakeholders. A service scientist might solve known problems by connecting new service systems to the problematic aspects of the original service system. Models and analytical methods for service systems will allow us to find opportunities for efficiency gains and to create new information based services.

AB  - The service sector accounts for most of the world's economic activity, but it's the least-studied part of the economy. A service system comprises people and technologies that adaptively compute and adjust to a system's changing value of knowledge. A science of service systems could provide theory and practice around service innovation. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, technology roadmaps have been actively constructed by various organizations such as governments, industry segments, academic societies and companies [1]. While the common basic purpose of these roadmaps is sharing common recognition of the technology among stakeholders, there exists a specific role for each organization. One of the important roles of academic societies is to show the directions in which society is moving. The IEICE technical group on Concurrent System Technology (CST) established in 1993 stands at a turning point and needs to move forward in new directions after more than a decade of activities and contributions. However, neither top-down (market-pull/ requirements-pull) nor bottom-up (technology-push) roadmapping is suitable for CST because CST is a kind of systems engineering. This paper proposes a new technology roadmapping methodology (middle-up-down technology roadmapping) for systems engineering and shows three future directions of CST and one roadmap for service systems that integrate CST and services science. © 2007 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - With the development of information technology, service industry is no longer the representative of low skills and low paying jobs any more. Modern service, especially knowledge intensive service, is becoming one of the main competitive sources of a company or nation. Yet today, the productivity of service is still comparatively low, urgently needing innovation and improvement in our service system. Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME) is an emerging discipline which dedicates to the study of service system. SSME education aims to train sufficient eligible service workers and scientists in order to promote innovation and productivity in service industry. Although several universities started SSME programs a few years ago, very little experience about SSME education is available currently. This paper first discusses the aims of SSME education program, mainly about the abilities that service worker and scientist should have. Then, several cases of the present programs are discussed, analyzing some of the common features as well as differences among them. In the last part of this paper, we put forward some suggestions for SSME education, including the curriculum, lecturer, education level, program partner, and so on.

AB  - The service sectors now represent 80% of the developed economies. Currently there is a lack of understanding of the science underlying the design and operation of service systems. New conceptual understanding and theoretical underpinnings are required to systematically describe the nature and behaviour of service systems. To better understand complexity from a service design perspective, it is necessary for us to turn to theories of human behaviour at the individual, group and organisational levels and beyond. Activity theory (AT) is one such theory that seems particularly well suited to the endeavour. It is valuable in helping to explain the complexity of service systems involving people, technology and organisations. This paper proposes AT as a paradigm for modelling service system design and discusses how the implications of AT are suitable for designing service systems.

AB  - There are several essential legal topics that must be included in the research agenda of service science. In this paper, we discuss these topics, beginning with an analysis of the definition of a service and a categorization of some of the actors in service systems, with their diverse interests. A set of case studies and scenarios is presented to illustrate the kinds pf legal challenges that are involved in providing user-centric and customer-oriented services. We conclude by suggesting the most important legal topics that should be studied further in relation to service science. © Copyright 2008 by International Business Machines Corporation.

AB  - Service industries comprise roughly 75 percent of the gross domestic product of developed nations. To design and operate service systems for today and tomorrow, a new type of engineer must be educated, one who focuses on services rather than manufacturing. Such an engineer must be able to integrate three sciences-management, social, and engineering science - in the analysis of service systems. Within the context of the Center for Engineering Systems Fundamentals, a research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we discuss how newly emerging service systems require such a three-way integrated analysis. We deliberately select some nonstandard services, because many business services, such as supply chains, have been studied extensively. © Copyright 2008 by International Business Machines Corporation.

AB  - The creation of value is the core purpose and central process of economic exchange. Traditional models of value creation focus on the firm's output and price. We present an alternative perspective, one representing the intersection of two growing streams of thought, service science and service-dominant (S-D) logic. We take the view that (1) service, the application of competences (such as knowledge and skills) by one party for the benefit of another, is the underlying basis of exchange; (2) the proper unit of analysis for service-for-service exchange is the service system, which is a configuration of resources (including people, information, and technology) connected to other systems by value propositions; and (3) service science is the study of service systems and of the co-creation of value within complex configurations of resources. We argue that value is fundamentally derived and determined in use - the integration and application of resources in a specific context - rather than in exchange - embedded in firm output and captured by price. Service systems interact through mutual service exchange relationships, improving the adaptability and survivability of all service systems engaged in exchange, by allowing integration of resources that are mutually beneficial. This argument has implications for advancing service science by identifying research questions regarding configurations and processes of value co-creation and measurements of value-in-use, and by developing its ties with economics and other service-oriented disciplines. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper is a first exploration of the relationship between service science and Grid computing. Service science is the study of value co-creation interactions among entities, known as service systems. Within the emerging service science community, service is often defined as the application of competences (resources) for the benefit of another. Grid computing is the study of resource sharing among entities, known as virtual organizations, which solve complex business, societal, scientific, and engineering problems. Within the Grid computing community, service is sometimes defined as protocols plus behavior. Both Grid computing and service science are connecting academic, industry, government, and volunteer sector collaborators on a range of projects including eScience, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and more. This paper compares and contrasts the notions of resource, entity, service, interaction, and success criteria for the two areas of study. In conclusion, new areas for collaborative inquiry are proposed. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

AB  - Service systems are value-co-creation configurations of people, technology, value propositions connecting internal and external service systems, and shared information (e.g., language, laws, measures, and methods). Service science is the study of service systems, aiming to create a basis for systematic service innovation. Service science combines organization and human understanding with business and technological understanding to categorize and explain the many types of service systems that exist as well as how service systems interact and evolve to co-create value. The goal is to apply scientific understanding to advance our ability to design, improve, and scale service systems. To make progress, we think service dominant logic provides just the right perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory of service systems, their configurations, and their modes of interaction. Simply put, service-dominant logic may be the philosophical foundation of service science, and the service system may be its basic theoretical construct. © Academy of Marketing Science 2007.

AB  - Abstraction is a powerful thing. During the nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as mass, energy, work, and power. During the twentieth century, the information revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as binary digit or bit, binary coding, and algorithmic complexity. Here, we propose an abstraction for the twenty-first century, in which there is an emerging revolution in thinking about business and economics based on a service-dominant logic. The worldview of service-dominant logic stands in sharp contrast to the worldview of the goods-dominant logic of the past, as it holds service - the application of competences for benefit of others - rather than goods to be the fundamental basis of economic exchange. Within this new worldview, we suggest the basic abstraction is the service system, a configuration of people, technologies, and other resources that interact with other service systems to create mutual value. Many systems can be viewed as service systems, including families, cities, and companies, among many others. In this paper, we show how the service-system abstraction can be used to understand how value is co-created, in the process laying the foundation for an integrated science of service. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

AB  - The widespread usage of technology for service provision to customers has created a new and challenging environment for the design of interactive systems, with the emergence of technology enabled multi-channel services. Requirements engineers involved in the design of such service systems must actively work together with interaction designers and service managers to better integrate customer service experience and technology components, requiring unifying methods and tools within the emerging field of service science management and engineering. This paper proposes the service experience blueprint (SEB), a multidisciplinary method for the design of technology enabled multi-channel service systems and illustrates its application in two examples of redesign of banking services that involved an extensive study with more than 4,000 bank customers. The SEB method is based on concepts and tools from RE and interaction design, such as goal-oriented analysis and conceptual modeling, but also uses methods developed in the service and marketing fields, such as service blueprinting. SEB brings marketing research methods to the requirements process, as they can provide a useful contribution for the elicitation of customer experience requirements in service environments. By bringing together goal-oriented modeling and use case modeling from requirements engineering, with service blueprinting from service design, the SEB method contributes to creating a shared understanding and a unifying language to better support the design of new technology enabled multi-channel service systems, where technology and service issues are deeply intertwined. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2009.

AB  - Purpose - With B2B (business-to-business) and new developments in marketing as the springboard, this paper seeks to emphasize complexity and context in marketing systems, embracing both B2B and B2C (business-to-consumer) marketing. Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a conceptual analysis of new developments in marketing through network theory and case study research. Findings - Recent theory points to a network and systems approach to marketing and to changing roles between suppliers and customers. Both many-to-many marketing as a broadening of relational approaches and the service dominant (S-D) logic stress consumer involvement, exposing the customer's interactive role. The IBM service science programme enrols research and education in developing more functional service systems. The conventional divide in goods and services marketing is dissolved in favour of supplier-customer interaction. Research limitations/implications - B2B and B2C are both part of complex contexts. Case study research and network theory allow complexity and context to come forward. Network theory should be applied in all marketing, and concepts in marketing need to be constantly evaluated as to validity and relevance. The conventional sectors (manufacturing, services, agriculture) are supplier-centric whereas marketing prescribes customer centricity. By focusing on continuous theory generation better theory will replace previous theory. Practical implications - Marketers overview the complexity of specific marketing situations, to systematically observe relational phenomena and the customer's role, and will be better able to foresee opportunities and avoid mistakes in marketing planning and execution. Originality/value - The paper offers a network view which is little represented in research and education. With growing dependency on larger integrated systems such a coherent view becomes increasingly more urgent. In a new marketing logic of service and value creation, the reductionism, fragmentation and linearity of Western science are challenged in favour of a comprehensive network approach. B2B and B2C are treated as perspectives of a grander marketing context and not as independent categories, and the broadened role of customers in value networks is recognized. Goods and services can only be understood and handled in a unified context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Service science, management and engineering (SSME) research is to study the methodology and technology for service innovation, design, development and delivery. Since service industry is very quality-sensitive and trust-dependent, we propose a service accountability management framework to detect, diagnose, defuse and disclose the root cause for any problematic service process. The accountability support is important for SSME since service processes often rely on external service providers to deliver part of the service functionalities. A service system must have effective yet efficient mechanisms to ensure that every external service is delivering a consistent and acceptable level of performance to meet the end-to-end quality of service (QoS) of the whole service process. In this paper, we present the accountability framework, identify the components in an accountable service architecture, and design an accountability diagnosis methodology. We also briefly present the inteLLigent Accountability Management Architecture (LLAMA) project which implements the accountability service bus (ASB), an agent-based middleware to support the monitoring, diagnosis, and reconfiguration of e-services. LLAMA ASB interacts with accountability agents to monitor services and the Accountability Authority to automatically diagnose faulty situations. The LLAMA technology is useful to ensure the QoS in SSME-based systems. © The Author(s) 2009.

AB  - We introduce this special issue by addressing seven key challenges associated with managing hybrid humanautomated service systems. These consist of the following: 1. What strategic and tactical issues arise when managing hybrid service systems? 2. How should the core "value proposition" be set? 3. What special considerations arise in the design and implementation phases? 4. How can service delivery be managed to identify systemic problems and to address service breakdowns? 5. How can communications with clients improve the functioning of service systems? 6. What performance measures should be used to monitor process, outputs, client perceptions, and financial outcomes? 7. How can we coordinate the various interdisciplinary activities needed to address the previous six issues? We consider these challenges after first characterizing the historical evolution of service delivery, reviewing some of the literature in the administrative sciences, and proposing a conceptual framework.

AB  - There has been an increase in the relevance of and interest in services and services research. There is a acknowledgement that the emerging field of services science will need to draw on multiple disciplines and practices. There is a growing body of work from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers and practitioners that consider services, but there has been limited interaction between service researchers and HCI. We argue that HCI can provide two major elements of interest to service science: (1) the user centred mindset and techniques; and (2) concepts and frameworks applicable to understanding the nature of services. This second option is of major concern in this paper, where we consider Long's work (undertaken with John Dowell) on a Conception for HCI. The conception stands as an important antecedent to our own work on a framework that: (a) relates the various strands of servicer research; and (b) can be used to provide high-level integrative models of service systems. Core concepts of the UCL Conception such as domain, task, and structures and behaviours partially help to relate systematically different streams of services research, and provide richer descriptions of them. However, if the UCL Conception is moved towards services additional issues and challenges arise. For example, the kinds of domain changes that are made in services differ; services exist in a wider environment; and that effectiveness judgements are dependent on values. We explore these issues and provide reflections on the status of HCI and Service Science. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been promoted as a technology that can enhance information systems agility, interoperability between applications, deployment flexibility, and reusability. As with any new information technology (IT), the decision to adopt SOA cannot be taken lightly, given the nontrivial investment in economic and personnel resources. The complexity associated with industry-wide diffusion, coupled with organization, industry, and environment factors, contributes to a lack of a clear strategy for assessing the business value that SOA provides an organization. This research attempts to shed light on this process of value creation for an organization, using a system dynamics approach. A detailed model of the industry diffusion coupled with organization adoption is presented. After suitable calibration and validation, a series of simulations using the model evaluate the efficacy of SOA under a variety of diverse conditions. The results of the simulations indicate clear benefits of SOA over monolithic ITs when employed under appropriate conditions. Situations where SOA fails to live up to expectations are also identified. The model and accompanying simulations can serve as a practical decision support tool for an organization to help make the strategic decisions of adopting and implementing SOA. © 2010 M.E.

AB  - Companies in collaborative networks require intermediation to perform. The collaborative network forms the breeding environment for the configuration of a Virtual Enterprise that can handle a business request. This configuration task can be supported by IT services. For collaborative networks such as production networks focused on non-digital services and products we propose to assign specific intermediation tasks to a human network moderator supported by these IT services. The obvious support is targeted for the configuration of the Virtual Enterprise i.e. the search and selection from the available products, services, and competences found among the network participants. The configuration decision can jeopardize the network performance by harming the trust necessary to build new Virtual Enterprises. Through a further intermediation task trust can be inspired and promoted in the network. This article shows how the configuration is supported by a Decision Support Service and how a Transparency Support Service supports the downloading and acceptance of decisions in collaborative networks. The article outlines the IT supportive service system and exemplifies the use by a scenario example. Results on intermediation in collaborative networks can prove helpful for general service science problems. © J.UCS.

AB  - This paper reports out of the symposium on 'Technology Management in the Service Sector' which was held as a part of Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology in 2007. The objectives of the symposium were: to explore how technology management research and education can contribute to the evolving field of services science, management and engineering; to define a research agenda for the field of engineering and technology management that addresses the critical needs of the evolving service economy and to discuss needed funding structures and programs to foster service oriented research. We tackled these issues in two ways. First, the key leaders from academia, industry and government presented the critical issues and challenges that presently exist. Then, small groups analysed the selected topics in depth. We identified three main components of service science: value, people and technology, and explored how researchers in the field of technology management would tackle this new phenomenon.

AB  - This paper discusses the need and possible forms of human interfaces to Internet services, challenging the common notion that Internet services are simply computercomputer systems governed by machine protocols with little need of concern for human issues. We first examine the case where Internet services are provided to human users, showing that the user-system interaction becomes a typical service relationship, which can be better understood in the framework of Service Science. Based on the six basic characteristics of services we explore 15 issues which should be taken in account when designing human interfaces for Internet services. We also depart from traditional HCI by arguing that the fundamental goal of the human interface of an Internet service is to create and maintain a relationship with the user. We then look into Internet services being used by computer applications, where we discuss the need of a backdoor human interface for the maintenance and control people working in the Internet service provision system. Both situations have been little explored by the Internet services or the HCI fields of research. © The Brazilian Computer Society 2011.

AB  - The hallmark of service-value co-creation-is not easy to achieve in B2B IT service engagements. Typically, client and provider are both complicated organizational entities with multiple agendas and diverse stakeholders, and engagements often extend over years. We analyzed a number of IT service engagements to better understand their complex dynamics, with the ultimate goal of improving their outcomes. This paper reports on our study of how value co-creation unfolds over time, and identifies basic dynamics central to the modeling of service systems-actualization of service and realization of value-that are reflected in the proposed framework. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper considers two different contexts for KISS - high contact KISS, where there is high degree of ongoing interaction between customer and supplier - and mass-market KISS, which typically provide standardised services via automated systems. It considers how different contexts can affect how two key concepts of service science - value co-creation and the service system - are linked. Within the literature, there are two main views linking these concepts. In one view, value arises from the interaction between service systems. An alternative view sees the service system as a single entity that includes both supplier and customer, who collectively create value. The paper argues that neither description is more accurate than the other, but that high contact KISS are best viewed as a single service system co-creating value, while for mass-market KISS, it is more appropriate to think of a supplier system making value propositions to customer systems. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Service systems in general take a holistic approach to include several aspects, e.g., organisational structure, economics, people, and IT. They are in principle not limited to organisational boundaries. This paper considers a multi-actor service system of collaborating organisations for value exchange (the Beer Living Lab) to analyse the applicability of a particular modelling technique for interoperability modelling in service systems. This paper will look at Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO), an open standard for abstractly specifying interoperability. The central core of WSMO is mediation between goals of service consumers and capabilities of service providers. It can easily be applied to simple, atomic interaction patterns like request - response, but usability of WSMO for modelling knowledge intensive service systems is insufficient. Modelling service systems comprising many organisations must support autonomy of those organisations. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This paper applies a new framework of systems science to service science. This new framework reveals the effect of the interactions between systems principles and system structure in revealing complex systems behaviour, demonstrates why such methodologies are classed as being systemic, and how these systemic methodologies can be used to explore, design and manage emergent complex behaviour in practice. This paper then proposes that this framework of ideas can be transferred to inform the content of the existing roadmap for researching service systems, and thereby improve the design of new intentionally holistic service systems and the understanding and management of existing service systems and knowledge intensive service systems. Further research will investigate cases of complex scenarios in service systems, with the aim of transferring that knowledge (and its implications) to the fields of research, practice and education in both systems science and service (systems) science. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - A great deal of recent research on services has focused on knowledge-intensive services of various types. These are seen as particularly important activities, mobilising and applying high levels of professional expertise in specific service encounters, where solutions to problems are defined and sometimes implemented. In the context of new interest in service science, too, the role of service systems has been stressed, since the production of services involves interaction of various resources (technology, information, etc.) and actors (not least the service client). This essay begins with an exploration of definitional and empirical approaches associated with research on services, and on knowledge-intensive services, before considering whether and how the notion of knowledge-intensive service systems (KISS) can be usefully developed. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Designing product-service systems is challenging because of the broad and under-defined scope of the task. Design teams must integrate various solution elements, such as hardware, software, service, and infrastructure, while resolving the communication challenges among different domain-experts. Design for Service Innovation enables design teams to effectively deal with ambiguity and to communicate their ideas among team members and managers, as well as with customers through a common language. We validated the effectiveness of design for service innovation (DfSI) in both academia and industry. This paper describes the process and the preliminary results of the validation based on three approaches: hypothesis testing, voting and interviews. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Virtualization is commonly known in computer science as an abstraction technique of computer resources -physical platforms and resources -so that applications or end-users can seamlessly interact with these resources without the needs to deal with physical requirements. Going beyond the simulation of computer environments and resources, this paper proposes a paradigm for designing complex information systems based upon the concept of virtual modeling. The idea is to allow modelers use a virtual environment that is composed of real modeling platforms to replicate complex real problems, and explore new and virtual problems that might have high potential for real-life applications. Modeling here is not just an effort to find (new) solutions to an existing problem, rather it is also a discovery process seeking to create new (problems). We see this approach as vital in addressing the applications emerging from service science, management and engineering (SSME), which will rely upon computational modeling approaches as much, if not more, than traditional supply-chain based analytical modeling. We illustrate our design methodology with a telemedicine application using Brahms, a multi-agent programming language developed by the NASA. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The paper studies retail stores sale service of the fast consumer goods manufacturers by adopting service science theory and service innovation theory. There is still room for improvement, to meet the requirement of the development of service science, in such aspects of retail stores sale service as service system construction, file management, ancillary sales system, logistic service and sales staff. However, retail stores sales and service innovation in the implementation phase are still faced with such challenges as the low informatization level, lack of professionals, and backwardness in ideology. How to deal with those challenges is an important issue for the future development of retail stores sale service. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Today, enterprises have to be customer and service oriented in order to adapt themselves to a more and more competitive and evolving context. Their innovators (actors of the innovation) have to collaborate in order to anticipate the customers' needs. To do so, they work as a virtual team (a remote and inter-professional network) and try to describe services situations, to detect lacks and opportunities, and to propose the design of adapted solutions. Based on the service literature and the discussions of the Service Science Management and Engineering (SSME) discipline, we conceive the service as a dynamic configuration of heterogeneous entities: a "Service System". We then suggest formalizing it with a mereological ontology (collective classes instead of distributive classes) of processual entities (processes instead of substances) in order to highlight its dynamic dimension. The Service System acts as an intermediary object aiming at the innovators' cooperation and creativity during a co-design phase. Its modelling reveals all the possible experiences within a situation through the identification of the relationships between processual entities. A co-modelling process and a web-based tool are currently tested upstream of the services design process of a French telecom operator. This operator's process and experiments are good examples. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article contributes to the emerging discipline of service science through an empirical investigation of value propositions as connections between service systems. The starting point for our research is that service science is an interdisciplinary approach to the study, design and implementation of service systems, a service system being considered a dynamic configuration of resources (people, technology, organisations and shared information) that create and deliver value between the provider and the customer through service (IfM and IBM 2008). Specifically, this article investigates value propositions in the context of equipment-based service systems. Our qualitative findings identify three value proposition cycles: Recovery, Availability and Outcome. In so doing, showing that providers offer three distinct propositions of value with three different primary transformations. This research contributes to theory in service systems by identifying value propositions as multiple, simultaneous and iterative connections between provider and customer systems. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to propose a systems interpretation of the concept of complexity and its implications for a theoretical discussion of the concept of boundary in complex service systems. The proposal highlights the interpretative contribution of a dual perspective of observation that distinguishes between a structure-based view and a systems-based view. When dealing with complexity, the phenomenon under investigation cannot be addressed through management approaches that aim to measure and control it in a vain attempt to find the best solution. Due to the inner nature of complexity, a more rewarding approach to a full understanding of problematic situations should place consolidated management models within a more general interpretation framework that suggests preliminary insights about the real nature of the investigated phenomenon.First, this paper outlines the theoretical background of the literature on service, service systems and complex service systems, providing evidence of the contribution of recent service research advances such as service science and service-dominant logic. Next, the paper focuses on the basic principles of systems thinking to introduce the Viable Systems Approach (. vSa) as a general framework of reference for both the investigation and the governance of social organisations.The vSa conceptual framework is adopted for proposing some reflections from a systems perspective in the investigation of the case of the London Borough of Sutton (LBS). The focus is on interpreting the paradoxical situation of an increased fear of crime among LBS residents despite the evidence of reduction in the crime rate. Although the incidence has fallen for most types of crimes, a recent poll confirmed that crime is still rated as the most important issue for residents. Therefore, improving safety and reducing crime remain the top priorities for the Safer Sutton Partnership Service. In short, this study proposes to consider " reducing the fear of crime in a community" as a complex service system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The goal of Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME) is to improve service systems through service innovation. However, current SSME infrastructure lacks a comprehensive quality management framework and the SSME research on people is limited. Users' service expectation has increased a lot along with the development of ICT. Single organization usually cannot fulfill user's needs comprehensively. This study first analyzes the shortcomings of current system development and quality evaluation methodologies, and points out that these methods cannot meet the requirement of crossorganizational services; then, by considering the idea of Mashup and quality management model in service ecosystem, this study proposes a theoretical architecture of service system, and a preliminary quality management model under SSME context. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

AB  - The growth of service sector in recent years has led to renewed research interests in the design and management of service systems. Decision support systems (DSS) play an important role in supporting this endeavor, through management of organizational resources such as models and data, thus forming the "back stage" of service systems. In this article, we identify the requirements for semantically annotating decision models and propose a model representation scheme, termed Semantically Annotated Structure Modeling Markup Language (SA-SMML) that extends Structure Modeling Markup Language (SMML) by incorporating mechanisms for linking semantic models such as ontologies that represent problem domain knowledge concepts. This model representation format is also amenable to a scalable Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for managing models in distributed environments. The proposed model representation technique leverages recent advances in the areas of semantic web, and semantic web services. Along with design considerations, we demonstrate the utility of this representation format with an illustrative usage scenarios with a particular emphasis on model discovery and composition in a distributed environment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The design of Decision Support Systems have recently emphasized web enablement as the next step in design improvements for this class of applications. We argue that these approaches fail to address the key notion of adaptability in the support for decision makers. Instead of focusing exclusively on automation in decision making, we believe it is also necessary to pay attention to the interplay between decision makers and organizational processes. The service oriented view of organizations recognizes the need to accommodate the changing reality of organizational dynamics. For example, the service science approach focuses on interactions between service providers, their clients, and consumers as important interacting components of a service system. Current approaches to DSS design are constrained in terms of their ability to adapt to changes in user requirements and to provide support for the evolution of systems. This situation worsens when resources are distributed at different locations across organizations, decision making processes are required to be integrated at different points in time, and when collaboration is needed among decision makers. However, this typically characterizes the needs of collaborative decision making in networked organizations as exemplified by systems used for supply chain management. To address these problems we leverage the power of services for designing a framework that explicitly recognizes the need for design based on service delivery. We develop an agent-enabled service-oriented architecture to realize the proposed framework with service and agent paradigms. The architecture is refined and validated with an implementation in the supply chain context. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The authors aim to describe the mutual perspectives of sustainability and service science and characterize them for the design and development of more sustainable services and to promote an overall shift toward sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a novel model for the design of services that fulfill customer demands and that can be continued for long periods of time without having a negative impact on either the natural or the social environment. Sustainability was therefore incorporated into the service supply chain not only as a primary value, but also as a super value that enables the customer to deliver sustainability to the next generation. Findings: The authors' findings suggest that a sustainable service should both imbue the core-value of the service with sustainability and recruit the customer as a supplier of sustainability to future generations. Thus, sustainable service should mimic natural processes, in so doing achieving energy efficiency, using future-oriented and life cycle perspectives, and evolving to smoothly adapt to changes in its environment. Moreover, sustainable service should account for the rational use of natural resources, technologies, and information and knowledge and integrate environmental, social, and economic elements together with the inclusion of services and of manufacturing and agricultural processes. Originality/value: The authors present a novel approach and a model that conceptualizes sustainability as a service while exploring the benefit of doing so, both for sustainability and for service science. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using four basic principles of service science, we systematically explore value-proposition design as one type of business model innovation. Service science combines organization and human understanding with business and technological understanding to categorize and explain service systems, including how they interact and evolve to cocreate value. Our goal is to apply a scientific approach to advance design and innovation in service systems. Our foundation is service-dominant logic, which provides perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory. Our basic theoretical construct is the service system, entities that are dynamic configurations of four kinds of resources. Our core principles center on the way value is computed within and among entities, how interaction is based on access to resources and their capabilities, and on how value computation and interaction depend on symbol processing and language guided by mutually agreed-to value propositions. In this context, service science can inform and accelerate value-proposition design by systematizing the search for adaptive advantages that improve existing offerings, create new offerings, or reconfigure the value-creating ecosystem. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Service science offers fresh perspective to reorient the debate on what is 'progress' and whether or not it is slowing down, and if so, what might be done to reframe progress 'at the speed limit of what is possible' with universities. When it comes to the 'rate of progress', universities can play a greater role in improving the deeply interconnected societal measures of innovativeness, competitive parity, sustainability and resiliency. During the current 'great recession', much is now being written about progress slowing down. From education levels to scientific discoveries to technical innovations to economic and environmental collapse, rhetoric about progress slowing down or nearing collapse or becoming uncompetitive in developed economies is on the rise. Boulding suggested in 'the skeleton of science' that over-specialization could create communication barriers between scientific specialists slowing down profitable talk. We propose that a service science reframing of progress with universities as essential institutional actors might positively reorient the debate. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Service Science has slowly been coming into focus in the last few years as a multidisciplinary approach to more effective management in the service industry. It is a new and highly relevant branch of knowledge for information professionals. This article explains what it is, how it has arisen and how important it could be for information service management, development and innovation. Service Science already features in the curricula of business schools and merits introduction into Library and Information Science courses and the practice of service provision. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Purpose: The servitization of manufacturing is a diverse and complex field of research interest. The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrative and organising lens for viewing the various contributions to knowledge production from those research communities addressing servitization. To achieve this, the paper aims to set out to address two principal questions, namely where are the knowledge stocks and flows amongst the research communities? And what are generic research concerns being addressed by these communities? Design/methodology/approach: Using an evidenced-based approach, the authors have performed a systematic review of the research literature associated with the servitization of manufacturing. This investigation incorporates a descriptive and thematic analysis of 148 academic and scholarly papers from 103 different lead authors in 68 international peer-reviewed journals. Findings: The work proposes support for the existence of distinct researcher communities, namely services marketing, service management, operations management, product-service systems and service science management and engineering, which are contributing to knowledge production in the servitization of manufacturing. Knowledge stocks within all communities associated with research in the servitization of manufacturing have dramatically increased since the mid-1990s. The trends clearly reveal that the operations community is in receipt of the majority of citations relating to the servitization of manufacturing. In terms of knowledge flows, it is apparent that the more mature communities are drawing on more locally produced knowledge stocks, whereas the emergent communities are drawing on a knowledge base more evenly distributed across all the communities. The results are indicative of varying degrees of interdependency amongst the communities. The generic research concerns being addressed within the communities are associated with the concepts of product-service differentiation, competitive strategy, customer value, customer relationships and product-service configuration. Originality/value: This research has further developed and articulated the identities of distinct researcher communities actively contributing to knowledge production in the servitization of manufacturing, and to what extent they are pursuing common research agendas. This study provides an improved descriptive and thematic awareness of the resulting body of knowledge, allowing the field of servitization to progress in a more informed and multidisciplinary fashion. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - As the world increasingly becomes characterized by the provision of services to customers, service research faces many challenges and needs a new vision. Many of these challenges stem from the fact that technologies are continually experiencing dramatic change, and savvy customers are increasingly demanding more qualified services. Although research and experiential findings on services in many disciplines have achieved impressive results, systematic research on modern services systems is rarely considered. Aiming at services systems (not only services themselves), this paper discusses the contributions and the potentials for the field of systems theory for Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Thus, SSME can provide suitable referential clues for discussing impacts of systems theory on services research, and systemic thinking can be applied to discuss key issues in SSME. Providing basic definitions of services and services systems, this paper elaborates on the research objects and methodologies of SSME from systems perspective, and proposes that systems theory can be applied as the foundations of services engineering. This paper further sheds light on systemic issues in services science and engineering, services operations, and services systems management. It also provides a summary of relevant theories and tools applied to services systems at the systems level. Finally, some potential prospects in SSME research are presented to meet research demands and practical challenges. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to describe a novel framework for service design to achieve the overall goal of sustainability and to characterize it while exploring the benefit of doing so for both sustainability and service. This novel framework also proposes new opportunities for sustainability-oriented innovation. Design/methodology/approach-The paper presents a novel approach to design and implement services that will lead to a reduction in the production of goods and will offer alternatives that will reduce whatever production process is involved in its creation, i.e. clean service-CleanServ.
Findings - The authors’ findings suggest that a CleanServ is a service that is competitive with, if not superior to, its conventional tangible or intangible counterparts and one that reduces the use of natural resources and cuts or eliminates emissions and wastes. CleanServs can be categorized into five different groups based on their fundamental contribution to sustainability: prevention, reduction, replacement, efficiency and offset. While the service sector continuous to grow in size and importance, CleanServs will play a key role in improving the sustainability of our society and in preserving the environment.
Practical implications - The CleanServ concept offers a new framework and novel opportunities for sustainability-oriented innovation in the service sector. Implementing CleanServs will enable services to be imbued with sustainability and will promote the exchange of the production of goods with the delivery of services that will supply the same solution more sustainably.
Social implications - CleanServs are expected to change how we consume both products and services and will, therefore, promote a more rational use of natural resources and will reduce the discharge of pollution to the environment. Implementation of the CleanServ concept will, thus, advance the current state of the art in sustainable development and improve quality of life on a global scale.
Originality/value - This paper presents a novel approach and a framework that conceptualizes clean services, which we term CleanServs, while exploring the benefit of doing so, both for sustainability and for service science. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose - Health is a fundamental populations’ need and an integral part of the socio-economic development of a country. However, it is required to explain the growing role of the private sectors in addressing various health care needs. The purpose of this paper is to analyse potential contribution, criticalities and conditions of success of public-private partnership (PPP) as a strategy to face the complexity of nationally relevant Italian and Indian service systems.
Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is built upon the basis of the viable systems approach (VSA) integrated with the fundamental interpretative elements of service science and service-dominant logic to contextualize interpretation to the management of service systems benefitting from recent advances in these research fields.
Findings - A VSA-based general framework of reference is built that is useful for analysing any relational context in which different aims and expectations need to be harmonized to make the collaboration effective. On the basis of this framework, first insights on Italian and Indian health care PPPs are proposed, highlighting key elements of analysis and criticalities that may challenge a positive conclusion on health care PPPs.
Practical implications - The implications of the study are both theoretical and practical. From a theoretical perspective, the study contributes to the scholarly understanding of complex health care system in Italy as well as in India with particular reference to the public-private collaboration phenomenon. It also suggests theoretical approaches in the form of a generic VSA-based framework as applicable. From a practical perspective, the study stimulates managers to a critical reflection about current health care management approaches which are reflected in the adoption of PPPs solutions.
Originality/value - The paper discusses relevant worldwide decision-making challenges, such as the equality in the populations’ access to health service, suggesting managers the way to create conditions of consonance among the diverse stakeholders for a successful health care PPPs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article presents a novel collaborative service system (CSS) design methodology supporting the work of multiple participating users and collaborative services processes. The CSS application of music content creation paradigm called DesignStorming as it pertains to CSS modeling and developing. CSS is an interactive service system that can be systematic service innovation and automatic semi-automated value co-creation between service providers and customers to enhance service productivity. The objectives of this research are threefoldâ"€to propose a novel design methodology for CSS, to incorporate simple service machine (SSM) and intelligent service machine (ISM) for CSS, and to demonstrate a CSS application of music content creation. SSM is a road map that can be used to define the salient attribute elements for CSS design. According to the predefined SSM, ISM conducts modeling the cognitive process of service exchanges and service provision, their knowledge representations, and value co-production process for a computerized CSS. DesignStorming demonstrates how a CSS can be automated the interactive communications and problem solving processes during the music content creation work. The CSS application involves the three system components: 1) Ontology Developer, 2) SFGA Partnership Matcher, and 3) Co-created Value Appraiser. In addition, a service evaluation model is described and evaluated, so that some of their important characteristics can be identified. Such a comprehensive design methodology can provide the foundation for building future more diversified and innovative collaborative service system. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Heavy equipment manufacturing firms are increasingly challenged by the integration of service planning and execution in their established product-centred information systems (IS) environment. Despite a few standardisation efforts, there is no common understanding of service systems in industry goods companies and the corresponding requirements for the appropriation of information systems. We address this need by developing a maturity model. The design of the model is grounded in extant literature, focus group and case study research involving eleven organisations over 1.5 years. The evaluation confirms that the maturity model makes a novel and useful contribution to the design of service systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The management concept of service science (SS), and its origins in the business sector through evolving customer service expectations are explored in this chapter. It proposes the concept's utility-indeed its emerging necessity-as an administrative requisite to meet library users' needs. The chapter is a conceptual one addressing SS and service design (SD) approaches to building customer service systems for libraries, the why and how of implementation in libraries regardless of the community served-that is to say, the why and how of implementation in libraries regardless of the community served. The changing outlook of customers and managers regarding commercial service expectations is not disputed in the business and management literature. Extreme customer service has become a norm. However, these service expectations can and have carried over into the public and nonprofit sectors. This chapter proposes that libraries become aware of changing service norms and utilize SD methods to meet users' needs. Quite simply, libraries that do not investigate SD methods and implement community-specific design strategies, may begin to suffer patron dissatisfaction and even lose patronage. Alternatively, libraries which do adopt SD methods, may see increases in user satisfaction and patronage. SS and design are relatively novel subdisciplines of management studies. This, however, does not belie their importance. A broad introduction of the topics for library administration and planning considerations is warranted and necessary. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper aims to develop a service value network analysis approach based on system dynamics (SD) for analyzing the feedback structures that causes dynamic behavior of service value networks for value co-creation. The proposed approach defines the network objectives, identifies network actors and their interactions, builds SD models, conducts model tests, and evaluates possible policies that can be used to enhance the overall network performance. A case study of Taiwan’s mobile application services is used to illustrate the developed methodology. The developed methodology can help managers represent complex interactions and feedback structures of the service systems for value co-creation. In addition, decision makers can use the models to evaluate alternative scenarios for better understanding the system behavior that can improve the policy design and evaluation. Finally, we recommend that the case company should sense the market development of mobile application services continuously and improve its service quality on both user and developer sides relentlessly for sustaining its market growth. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Professor Leonard Kleinrock has made key contributions during the initial stage of development in computer communication networks from several aspects. One of them is the ingenious application of queueing theory to the performance evaluation of communication networks. Queueing theory is still useful in contemporary service systems having human customers and servers as precious resources. However, some new theoretical development is needed to cope with human service systems. In this article, the potential of queueing theory is discussed in the scope of emerging service science. We begin with a snapshot of Professor Kleinrock's laboratory in the early 1980s. We then review the performance metric called power worked out by Kleinrock as it determines the optimal input rate in a service system. As an example of service science for healthcare, we show modeling of obstetric patient flow in a hospital by means of Little's law and a network of M/M/m and M/G/∞ queues. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The digital divide is usually conceptualized through goods-dominant logic, where bridging the divide entails providing digital goods to disadvantaged segments of the population. This is expected to enhance their digital capabilities and thus to have a positive influence on the digital outcomes (or services) experienced. In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education. This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries. The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society. But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources. Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated. Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined. The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources-knowledge, technology, and institutions-through which value-creating usercentric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved. The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement. The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage. Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations: obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration.

AB  - Service science views companies as service system entities that interact with other entities to create value. In today's networked value chains competition is no longer among companies, but among networks that may be regarded as service ecologies. Following service science each entity comprises a dynamic configuration of resources and structures, thus a variety of design aspects needs alignment within these ecologies. To manage service ecologies this article suggests to link insights from network management with service science. A multi-dimensional framework consistently describes the organizational aspects of network management among service system entities as well as the required processes to align activities between service system entities and the possible information systems to support network management. The framework emerged from a design-oriented research project based on eleven interviews with managers from financial service providers in Germany and Switzerland. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly expanding space for researchers, students, and professionals. Development of IoT applications is hindered by the lack of available design tools, methodologies, and interoperability. The creation of a standards-based, open source hardware and software platform paired with full documentation and educational materials greatly aids in the accelerated development of IoT applications and provides a fertile ground for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) educational opportunities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The unprecedented scale of Information Technology (IT) service delivery requires careful analysis and optimization of service systems. The simulation is an efficient way to handle the complexity of modeling and optimization of real-world service delivery systems. However, typically developed custom simulation models lack standard architectures and limit the reuse of design and implementation artifacts across multiple models. In this work, following the design science research methodology, based on a formal model of service delivery systems and applying an adapted software product line (SPL) approach, we create a design artifact for building product lines of IT service delivery simulation models, which vastly simplify and reduce the cost of simulation model design and development. We evaluate the design artifact by constructing a product line of simulation models for a set of IBM’s IT service delivery systems. We validate the proposed approach by comparing the simulation results obtained using our models with the results from the corresponding custom simulation models. The case study demonstrates that the proposed approach leads to 5–8 times reductions in the time required to design and develop related simulation models. The potential implications of the application of the proposed approach within an organization are quicker responses to changes in the business environment, more information to assist in managerial decisions, and reduced workload on the process reengineering specialists. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze relevant state of the art in the areas of Service Science, Business Modeling and Enterprise Engineering in specifying service systems. The main shortcoming identified essentially resides in the lack of capability to model the purpose and value of a given service system in a structured way to guide current and future development efforts. In order to address these issues, our research focuses on modeling enterprises as service systems along three perspectives, namely: construction, function and contribution to differentiate and integrate their teleological and ontological models. With the proposed approach, we are able to clearly specify how each component of an enterprise system provides a service - Thus value - To other components of the same system or of the environment along different, possibly intertwining and overlapped value chains.

AB  - People always say that the customer is god, but do they really understand this 'god'? In practice, the nature of service, such as its intangibility and heterogeneity, makes the effective management of service operations difficult. To better incorporate human behaviors and other complex factors to facilitate service management decisions, the authors propose a new approach called parallel service management. PSM, which follows the ACP framework, is an emerging methodology in complex systems modeling and analysis. In PSM, customer agents, service employee agents, service organization agents, and the service environment construct an artificial service system, which can run in parallel with the real service system. The authors developed an agent-based artificial service system for the Chengdu East Railway Station, which let them make better layout planning decisions. The modification plan was then implemented in the station and achieved significant increase in store entering rate. Statistical comparison proves PSM's potential to enhance the performance of the real service systems. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes an exploration towards the transposition of service science principles into design guidelines. This aims at capturing value co-creation service interactions embedding customer experience in service design and delivery activities. The new Socio-Technical Systems Engineering (STSE) process is proposed to guide improved design, and it is exemplified with a new real time service that provides integrated information for trip planning in a city. The STSE process supports a high level visual modelling approach assisted by model execution and simulation tools. From a service engineering perspective, the outcomes of this process are artefacts that automatically support consistency among design steps and effective integration of customer experience and stakeholder requirements through iterative cycles related to service design. The application of the STSE process in the design of an exploratory case study of a real time information and travel planning service is validated through simulation using an executable representation of requirements. It can be executed over more complex transport service offerings, with different resource allocation algorithms, or different public transport planning services over a sample of real users requesting information. Results of such a simulation are beneficial for the users, for the service providers, and for the authorities managing public transport in city or metropolitan areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper shows how service science principles may be used for engineering and realizing improved public transport services. It approaches a value co-creation perspective for the management of public transport service operations based on an activity-based model of a generic service system that allows capturing requirements for software intensive service systems. The main focus is on specific implementation issues of the activity-based model of the generic service system, with a strong accent on its most representative component, the service set-up and configuring unit. This model is applied in a case study for planning of a public transport service and describes how a specific service reconfiguring request is formulated. This examination is further used as a document of requirements that drives the construction of an agent-based model expressing value-creation interactions among service system's stakeholders in public transport services. The usefulness of the developed agent-based model for the analysis of service systems operational capabilities is suggested through simulation. A business scenario related to the management of public transport services is described, and the defined agent-based model is executed with the Presage2 multi-agent programming platform in order to capture specific issues of piece-of-work planning. The proposed approach, evaluated on the simple working scenario, fosters the role of service interaction modeling in supporting a public transport service system to dynamically adapt its operational capabilities in delivering good public transport services, as more or less quantifiable changes can affect service delivery over time. © Simulation Councils Inc.

AB  - Natural and business ecosystems are complex and dynamic service systems that interact through the utilization of ecosystem service offerings for human well-being. Currently, natural and business sciences have not developed a shared and common set of service-based terms or concepts for discussing ecosystem service offerings in the process of value co-creation. In this study, the ecosystem service approach was compared with marketing science's service-dominant logic. The terminology and concepts were harmonized, and the two approaches were then integrated into a service-dominant value creation (SVC) framework. The incorporation of natural ecosystems includes accounting for the flow of positive and negative impacts through associated value networks. Therefore, the term value-in-impact was proposed to describe these value flows. A case study of the global forest-based sector was then presented, demonstrating how to discuss current research challenges using the proposed framework. In conclusion, a shared service-dominant approach provides an opportunity for deeper inter-disciplinary discussion between natural and business sciences. This study represents a contribution towards the development of a holistic service science that includes consideration for natural ecosystems. The SVC framework also addresses many of the multidimensional challenges noted by previous sustainability frameworks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
